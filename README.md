# subreddit-classification-project-3
classifying subreddits


This is project #3 of the GA data science immersive course, focusing on predicting the corresponding subreddit of a reddit post based on the title and word content of the post. The purpose of this project was to practice using APIs to pull data from the internet, utilizing NLP to vectorize post content, and creating classification models to predict the associated subreddit.


As my subreddits of choice, I picked r/metal and r/metalcore, because I thought that they would be similar enough to make it a challenge to try to pull them apart.


Prompt: "For project 3, your goal is two-fold: using Reddit's API, you'll collect posts from two subreddits of your choosing. You'll then use NLP to train a classifier on which subreddit a given post came from. This is a binary classification problem."
