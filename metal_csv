You helped make our 11-part documentary TV series Metal Evolution a huge success. It hit #1 on VH1 Classic and MuchMore and has aired on networks in the UK, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Brazil, India. Australia and elsewhere.  Despite this success, however, there was one glaring gap in the series: There was no episode on Extreme Metal.  Like many of you, I grew up listening (and continue to listen) to bands like Death, Carcass, Napalm Death, Entombed, Celtic Frost, Opeth, Enslaved etc. and feel that Extreme Metal is not an underground obscurity in the history of metal - it‚Äôs a hugely important chapter in this story.  Also hundreds of fans from around the world have contacted us saying that an Extreme Metal episode needs to be made.  So we approached several networks about financing this ‚ÄúLost Episode‚Äù but they passed, saying it‚Äôs too extreme for their viewers. 

And so we‚Äôve launched an IndieGoGo campaign to raise funds to create this episode and I was hoping you could help spread the word about the campaign.  We need your help to raise $135,000 by December 14!  Details of the campaign, including cool donor gifts at various contribution levels can be found here: [http://www.indiegogo.com/ExtremeMetal] (http://www.indiegogo.com/ExtremeMetal)

59,"http://imgur.com/a/R6KdH

I'm still taking in just how bizarre/awesome yesterday was for me.  



Earlier this week, I noticed on Mastodon's FB page that Bill was looking to buy a Dan Armstrong Plexi guitar.  Since I was already considering selling mine in order to save up some cash, I sent a pm to their page with a picture of my guitar.  I didn't think much about it until yesterday morning when I read a response from the Mastodon page, asking for more details.  When I listed off a few blemishes on the guitar as well as the price I was asking for, Bill asked if I could make it to one of their shows.  The nearest gig was later that evening several hours away in Knoxville.  By 3pm, my brother and I were driving from North Carolina to Tennessee to make the deal happen.  None of our friends believed us when we said that we were likely selling one of my guitars to our favorite metal band.



Once we pull up to the venue in Knoxville, I gave Bill a call letting him know that we'd arrived.  We met him outside the tour buses, and after exchanging courtesies, he handed us two backstage passes and led us through the back door of the venue.  Once we'd gone upstairs to a small rehearsal space, I took out the Dan Armstrong guitar and handed it over.  I pointed out the blemishes I had mentioned beforehand to make sure he was still ok with purchasing it.  He proceeded to test it out for a few minutes, mostly playing a series of Black Flag riffs (nice touch), and once he was done, telling me that ""it's a deal.""  After completing the exchange, we talked for a few minutes over beers, and once they had to get ready for the show, he led us out of the backstage area.



My brother and I are still in shock over how we were able to sell a guitar, then have a beer afterwards with the guitarist from one of our all-time favorite bands.  Bill was cool and polite the entire time, and treated two nervous twenty-somethings to the best night we've had in a very long time.  As long as I see them using that guitar during future tours, I'll be happy for years to come.

90,"Regardless of whether it‚Äôs Rolling Stone magazine or a dedicated metal publication, nne point that everyone seems to agree on, was the sudden and abrupt decline in thrash. However, the notion that thrash immediately died as soon as the 90s begun is pretty unfounded. Pinpointing the death or stagnation of the genre is difficult, but at the start of the decade, thrash was as mainstream as it got. The Clash of the Titans tour was held that year (Megadeth, Slayer, Anthrax touring together) and a significant amount of great albums by bands like the ones mentioned or others like Sadus, Razor, Vio-lence, Forbidden, Sodom, etc dropped. 

Things slowly started to fade out the following year, even though 1991 was also a solid year for thrash. Sepultura‚Äôs Arise, Heathen‚Äôs Victims of Deception, Ripping Corpse‚Äôs Dreaming with the Dead, it keeps going on. But it was obvious that the winds of change were blowing, not just because other musical genres were getting big (like Grunge), but also thrash had already splintered into as many categories as it could (Death, prog, tech, funk, etc). Simply put, it was no longer as appealing to either underground or mainstream audiences. The abrupt change Metallica made with The Black Album in the middle of 91 seemed to confirm thrash had reached a commercial dead end and it didn‚Äôt take long for other bands to follow suit. Former thrash bands went in different directions. Some jumped on the [grunge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk5eU21fzHM) bandwagon, others tried to imitate Pantera (the heaviest mainstream metal got at the time) in hopes of remaining [relevant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVCSCvprP0M) and others simply quit their former [bands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkpOuqJbh0I) to form poorly aged [90s industrial/groove/post-thrash hybrids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDSg34Ft0HA).

So while one can squabble about particular dates, by 1992 the thrash well had dried up and people had simply moved on. Thrash would not see a full on revival until the late naughts when a new generation of bands tried to take the mantle. But even that‚Äôs not the whole story. Truth is, thrash still lingered on ‚Äì particularly in the Eastern European nations where the fall of Socialism meant many began to discover thrash just as it was fading out. South America still held out for some time as well and the late 90s gave us a small, niche black/thrash revival primarily situated in Europe. This primer focuses on all of these, whether it was the latecomers who unfortunately began or continued their career too late for anyone to care or the die hards who didn‚Äôt care about the musical shift happening around them (well, to some extent anyway).

The list encompasses releases from the **92-99* era, one album per band. For once, I decided to include some of the bigger bands with notable releases since thrash was so much more barren than any other genre perhaps with the exception of trad/heavy. I included all styles and albums I found to at least be good, with some being criminally underrated. I had to make a call several times about excluding certain albums for being not ‚Äúthrash‚Äù enough or if they fell into different categories (i.e. more death, trad or groove). Since there was some minor overlap with my mid/late 90s DM primer, some of the thrashier bands from there were added here.

**1992**

**[–ê—Å–ø–∏–¥ -  –ö—Ä–æ–≤–æ–∏–∑–ª–∏—è–Ω–∏–µ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvArjYkRqlo)** - Another well known act in thrash circles, Aspid‚Äôs only album is a strong showing of technical thrash metal in the vein of Coroner and Voivod. [Note: Make sure not to spin the 2007 re-issue as it is substantially sped up]

**[Assorted Heap ‚Äì Mindwaves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOVKO4607Ok)** - Compared to some of the other death/thrash mentioned on this list, Assorted Heap‚Äôs last album is a bit more ‚Äúout there‚Äù, opting for odd time signatures in line with other proggy/tech thrash bands of the time. 

**[Chemical Breath ‚Äì Chemical Exposure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWx_4_W7nPI)** - Chemical Breath are criminally underrated and one of the premier technical death/thrash bands of the Belgian scene ‚Äì sounding like a thrashier combination of Testimony of the Ancients and Leprosy.

**[Deathrow ‚Äì Life Beyond](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gJwn7M-e64)** - The long running Technical Teutonic thrash bands says goodbye with a slightly slowed down thrash affair that is still overflowing with riffs ‚Äì although often with a more melodic touch, a sign of the times.

**[Demolition Hammer ‚Äì Epidemic of Violence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDUwK5bbqhU)** - Likely to need no introduction, DH were one of the strongest bands in the death/thrash genre at the start of the 90s. While ‚ÄúTortured Existence‚Äù was a fine debut that straddled the line between a more aggressive bay area thrash with some death metal elements, EoV is a full on death/thrash assault. From beginning to end, there is no room for breathing as riffs abound, Vinny‚Äôs drumming creates seismic movements and James raspy Millie-esque vocals deliver a strong performance. A classic from beginning to end and an indispensable pick.

**[Entropy ‚Äì Ashen Existence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY178IEUUG0)** - Late to the game but by no means bad, Entropy‚Äôs debut is a technical thrash album with some minor death metal elements sprinkled on the top. Not quite as vicious as DH or Epidemic, but enough to satisfy death/thrash aficionados anywhere.


**[Eternal Dirge ‚Äì Morbus Ascendit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05oODw1lGMY)** - Technical and completely unpredictable death/thrash. Some parts even remind of very early Dark Tranquillity/Eucharist in the way they employ tremolo picking. A bit of a stretch calling this thrash but it will appeal to fans of the harsher end of thrash.


**[Epidemic ‚Äì Decameron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpZTOn1xHGk)** - Often overshadowed by the superior Demolition Hammer, Epidemic were also a notable death/thrash outfit that released a second full length on the same level. The difference between them and DH is that Epidemic feels like they cranked up the death metal factor significantly. However, this will undoubtedly appeal to fans of both death and thrash.

**[Exhorder ‚Äì The Law](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgukizxZ5QM)** - Somewhat famous for the comparisons with Pantera, Exhorder‚Äôs follow-up release gives much of what the debut did ‚Äì a crunchy guitar tone that delivers a good amount of groove without taking it in an excessive direction.

**[Magnus ‚Äì I Was Watching my Death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ebie63iIzZ0)** - An old gem from the early Polish scene, this has to be the most over the top death/thrash release mentioned here ‚Äì especially when it comes to the vocal delivery. Nonetheless, Magnus unleash an onslaught of riffs upon the listener that deliver when people expect intense death/thrash.

**[Merciless ‚Äì The Treasures Within](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NonM-CnNFno)** - Sandwiched in between the historical debut and the memorable Unbound lies this sophomore release by Merciless which delivers much of what made the debut so good ‚Äì a more aggressive and deathier take on the early Teutonic thrash of Kreator. 

**[Morbid Saint ‚Äì Destruction System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgxXNDDnmoQ)** - Well known in thrash circles for their debut and less for their follow-up, Destruction System was never technically released ‚Äì only spread around through tape until it got re-released over a decade later. You can tell by this point there has been a strong refinement in the songwriting, as songs feel more cohesive and less ‚Äúin your face‚Äù than Spectrum of Death ‚Äì but still make it a great effort.

**[Sadus ‚Äì A Vision of Misery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyRX_cIA3wE)** - Sadus are pioneers of the technical death/thrash school and on this release some of the intensity from Illusions and Swallowed in Black is gone, but in its place are some of the most interesting songs written in Sadus‚Äôs career.

**[Sarcofago ‚Äì Crush, Kill, Destroy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAgde9WWrVI)** - Before Sarcofago descended forever into mid 90s groove trends, they released this fine EP which definitely was partly influenced by more commercial bay area thrash acts but still retained a lot of the original South American black/death/thrash sound. 

**[Silent Scream -  From the Darkest Depths of the Imagination](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwJTs9pjYD0)** - Unknown death/thrash that‚Äôs more on the mid-paced side but with good doses of riffs. Not as good as some of the other releases from this year but still solid in its own right.

**[Solstice ‚Äì Solstice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uRyaYkymJY)** - Hailing from Florida, it‚Äôs obvious by Solstice‚Äôs debut that they were influenced by the blossoming death metal scene from their state, as this sounds like Malevolent Creation and Deicide with a stronger thrash element thrown in. Pummelling all the same.

**[Stygian ‚Äì Planetary Destruction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR1AxbMtlyk)** - While somewhat by the numbers thrash, Stygian does manage to carve an identity of its own within the political/socially conscious minded portion of the genre. If you dig Evil Dead or Sacred Reich, these guys are definitely for you whose harsher sounds sometimes invoke Gammacide.

**[Torr - Chc√≠pni o kus d√°l](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8raqEKzG3M)** - Stalwarts of the Czech scene, Torr‚Äôs 1992 album sort of continues the tradition of playing nasty Venom/Hellhammer worship with some death metal elements thrown on top. If you‚Äôre familiar with Torr‚Äôs other works, this will also be up your alley.

**[Torturer ‚Äì Oppressed by the Force](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dw8sMGfXQo)** - Raw technical death/thrash from Chile. Combines some of the American sounds of Sadus and Atheist with a dose of the old South American sound.

**[Psychosis ‚Äì Life Force](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHvoWPQCLUs)** - By far the ‚Äúsoftest‚Äù release here, LA‚Äôs Psychosis sounds like a slightly more melodic Testament circa The New Order era. Technically competent and with a solid vocal performance.


**1993**

**[Addictive ‚Äì Kick Em Hard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vn64ADNFm0g)** - Fairly solid thrash akin to later Dark Angel. Can occasionally drag on too much but still worth a spin. 

**[Antagonist ‚Äì Antagonist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVgjIgXywiQ)** - Short and sweet EP that sounds like Exodus/Laaz Rockit through a  technical blender.


**[Arbitrater ‚Äì Darkened Reality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UexJRb-X9vA)** - If this had been released 5 years prior, Arbitrater could have been a leading UK thrash band. Instead, their take on socially/politically conscious thrash ala Sacred Reich failed to make any kind of impact. It‚Äôs a shame because the guitar performance here is fairly good, but this was just too pass√© when it arrived.

**[Crash (Bul) ‚Äì Unreal Dreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mX6qAiWOjE)** - Crash‚Äôs one and only album sounds like a mesh of several 80s Germanic acts, particularly Destruction and Holy Moses. Maybe the latter band sounds unappealing, but this still a very great release with some unique twists and turns. Great stuff.

**[Crash (Kor) ‚Äì Endless Supply of Pain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzTnBza78e0)** - Another band that belongs squarely to the Sepultura school of thrash, Crash‚Äôs 1994 album sounds like the missing link between Beneath the Remains and Arise. Plenty of fast and vicious riffs, with some groove put on top. 

**[Crionic ‚Äì Different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwbJ6CBz8Dw)** - A technical thrash band that does a great job of balancing aggressive moments lifted from Slayer/Sepultura with some of the more quirky and offbeat moments from Voivod and Watchtower. Another Czech gem.

**[Cromok ‚Äì Forever in Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uECNriUyhM)** - Cromok is a long-standing Malaysian band that specialized in a much more melodic brand of thrash than anyone else, often focusing on long passages consisting solely of intricate guitar leads. Some parts remind me of Savatage, so calling this purely ‚Äúthrash‚Äù is a bit of a misnomer, but an interesting effort nonetheless.

**[Dead Head ‚Äì Dream Receiver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXk8g_VOvVE)** - Dead Head‚Äôs second album is one the cusp of just being pure death metal, but with sufficient remnants of thrash to make it onto here. Vicious and aggressive.

**[Gladiator ‚Äì Made of Pain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKsgmHnFFrE)** - The second album from Slovakia‚Äôs Gladiator could easily be a continuation of Beneath the Remains, complete with Cavalera-esque vocals (although a video that resembles more of Arise). Gladiator try to distinguish themselves more through their more melodic leads, but they are undoubtedly indebted to the Brazilian band.

**[Hellbound ‚Äì Blasphemy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3O--oJW7wMg)** - Completely unknown yet very competent raw Bay area thrash worship not too dissimilar to Exodus with some killer guitar solos.


**[Lunacy ‚Äì Believe?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUGHyUyg7JI)** - Weird proggy/tech thrash that reminds me if Voivod and crossover thrash were united as one. Plenty of great moments, but its cardinal sin is the length ‚Äì take out 5 songs and this would have gone from good to pretty damn good.

**[Merciless Death ‚Äì Sick Sanctities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrGJsJpXTpA)** - Cult legends in the Polish underground that deliver a 90s version of 80s death/thrash like Devastation, early Morbid Angel, Dark Angel to mention a few. Completely raw sounding and frantic in execution, definitely for those who love thrash and early Polish death metal.

**[Obliveon ‚Äì Nemesis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq3MRZT0Q-g)** - Obliveon‚Äôs original sounded was more grounded in their Canadian counterparts Voivod, but here they‚Äôve graduated to a more technical death/thrash sound not too dissimilar from Atheist, Sadus and (early) Cynic. 

**[Sacrificial ‚Äì Forever Entangled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RIrB7EcSVE)** - This sounds like a thrashier Entombed (vocalist even sounds like LG Petrov) with some groove added for good measure. One of Denmark‚Äôs best kept secrets.

**[Visitor ‚Äì Visitor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX-pD7fLEjM)** - Absolutely killer power/thrash that sounds more like USPM with some speed/thrash thrown on top. Imagine Agent Steel, Metallica, Griffin and Savatage all thrown in the blender ‚Äì you would essentially get Visitor. A lot of power/thrash misses the mark for me and goes far too soft for my taste, but Visitor get a perfect 50/50 blend in terms of style.

**[Vulture ‚Äì Easier to Lie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywJ1WqyIXBA)** - Dutch band that sound like they should have been living in the Bay Area given their technical prowess at delivering a good mix of Forbidden. Exceptionally rare album that deserves some love.

**1994**

**[Acid Drinkers ‚Äì Infernal Connection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moT8q61M-6o)** - Jokey crossover thrash that makes up for their dumb lyrics with some good riffs. 

**[Aftermath ‚Äì Eyes of Tomorrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=No3SBy7pb8k)** - While this came out in 94, it had been recorded since 89 and thus it came too late to have any kind of impact. Which is a shame, because Aftermath exhibit the better parts of prog/tech thrash and deliver a full length reminiscent of later Coroner. For fans of thrash that isn‚Äôt afraid to go down the experimental route, give this a spin.

**[Bloody Butcher ‚Äì Uncover the Justice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLwWRxRHhUM)** - Polish band that love themselves a bit of Sepultura, more specifically from the Arise era and sprinkle it with some Slayer on top. Fairly good but occasionally ruined by some degree of sameness and the dumb track ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a fucking Drunkard‚Äù. 

**[Canker ‚Äì Physical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_GcQfc7mtE)** - An absolutely unrelenting assault of death/thrash that somewhat reminds me of early Kreator, Sadus, Atheist and Merciless. One of the best kept secrets of the Spanish underground.

**[Hellwitch -  Anthropophagi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN0tEtkBQ4)** - Proficient technical death/thrash which goes for the Sadus/Death/early Cynic sound and occasionally veers into slower, more experimental territory (like in the title track).

**[Herm√©tica - V√≠ctimas del vaciamiento](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJnMLtlKn5k)** - Heroes in their native Argentina, Hermetica were one of the biggest metal bands of the day there and reached their commercial √°pex with this effort, which offers a more mid-paced take on the Metallica school of thrash with a handful of ‚Äúslower‚Äù tracks that tell stories of Argentinian society. Hermetica broke up after this and a few members formed Malon in its wake (a far inferior band). A great swansong for a solid band.

**[Nailbomb ‚Äì Point Blank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5jkAUyhDGY)** - A collaboration between Max Cavalera and Alex Newport from alt metal band Fudge Tunnel, Nailbomb‚Äôs only full length is very much a product of its time. The music is still solidly thrash, but with some hardcore punk and industrial elements sprinkled over the whole thing. As 90s as it might sound, it‚Äôs still a good output after the somewhat disappointing Chaos A.D.

**[Narcotic Greed ‚Äì Fatal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rsmv1nzCWjw)** - A relatively unknown Japanese band that after several demos delivered an extremely in your face debut that is essentially the spawn of Forbidden and Toxik (on World Circus). For those that want their thrash fast paced.

**[Phossatery ‚Äì Obscure Feelings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id07uxheQuk)** - A Cogumelo release from the mid 90s, Phossatery retains a lot of the Old South American sound of early Sepultura/Sarcofago but spruces it up with some doomy moments and deeper vocals reminiscent of Barney from Napalm Death. 

**[Terminator ‚Äì Plugged](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fElxhvZ7sE4)** - Terminator‚Äôs second album is a more refined take on the 80s Bay Area thrash scene, taking cues from Forbidden and Testament. There are some dumb groovy moments mid-way that interrupt the flow, but it‚Äôs still an enjoyable experience.

**[Witches ‚Äì 3.4.1.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOoT3n7U8g8)** - Witches are known for being the first French band with a woman growling. This album would be one of the absolute best from the booming death/thrash scene of that country if it didn‚Äôt sometimes plunge into more ‚Äúexperimental‚Äù portions that meander for far too long. However, where this album shines is in its tenacity and brilliant guitar leads.

**1995**

**[Blathudah ‚Äì Spawnography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVlYkX5uzOY)** - Aussie thrash that sounds like a more focused and aggressive version of Anthrax. Surprisingly very good aside from one joke track.

**[Celestial Pain ‚Äì Hatred](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sjvITO7Qaw)** - Side project of one of the Unanimated members, which happens to be malicious Teutonic thrash worship. Make sure to pick up the compilation and get the Aggression demo as well.

**[Debustrol ‚Äì Vyhlazen√≠](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtxsfWqWh0Q)** - Debustrol began their career as a Czech band delivering something in between raw Teutonic thrash ala Sodom/Kreator and first wave worship. They kept playing this style until the album before this one which was apparently alternative rock. 

**[Deviate NY ‚Äì Gallery of Death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f9xkY9asds)** - Some people think Demolition Hammer ended with ‚ÄúTime Bomb‚Äù, which was a decent attempt at the groove metal sound so prevalent at the time ‚Äì but absolutely nothing compared to their first two records (it wasn‚Äôt even meant to be released under that moniker). Well, James Reilly and Vinny Daze formed this band in the ashes of DH and produced one demo of very competent death/thrash. It‚Äôs not quite as vicious as EoV, but the drumming and riffing carry residual elements of those days. Most definitely worth listening to.

**[Form ‚Äì I Choose My Own](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9nhmjTPKDw)** - Very unique, interesting and catchy progressive/technical thrash not too dissimilar from Voivod and later Coroner. Not recommended for genre purists, but great for those who may want a non-traditional thrash album. 

**[Iced Earth ‚Äì Burnt Offerings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LrGSIYAn9c)** - Iced Earth has been associated for so long with power metal that people often forget their initial albums had a strong thrash element to them. Burnt Offerings is the last of these efforts and gives us a glimpse of the ‚Äúdarker‚Äù side of USPM, and by that I mean there is a duality on this album. On one side are the melodic Maiden/Priest leads and the operatic clean vocals and on the other is furious Ride The Lightning-esque riffing and deep bellowed vocals. A really standout album.

**[Insidia -  Guarda dentro te](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oUTazVBTIU)** - A band that manages to stay true to its 80s thrash roots while still sounding fresh and modern. By this I mean the core of the music is a solid mix of Metallica/Sepultura with some minor Pantera elements thrown in the mix. Good album for fans of trad thrash and Pantera/Machine Head.

**Ira Deum - Reincarnation of the Immortal Evil** - Unfortunately no samples from this album are on yt, but this is a pretty good thrashier version of mid-era Death circa Spiritual Healing/Human with some doses of Cynic sprinkled on top.

**[Nifelheim ‚Äì Nifelheim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEnrtmNiPgc)** - Familiar to most, Nifelheim are a no nonsense black/thrash band tracing their lineage to the early works of Sodom/Destruction/Bathory/Venom with a good dose of heavy metal (especially Iron Maiden) in their sound.

**[Nopresion ‚Äì Sobre Fosas y Vampiros](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIVYdyKjeO0)** - Another jewel hidden in the depths of the Spanish underground. Nopresion‚Äôs debut was fairly good Sepultura worship, but on the follow-up they‚Äôve increased their songwriting chops to a new level. This is still firmly Beneath the Remains/Arise influenced, but with a minor dose of hardcore and traditional metal influences that nicely break up the agitated tempo of this album. If you have to listen to one Sepultura-influenced band from this list and don‚Äôt want just a faceless clone, this is your best bet.

 **[Ritual Sacrifice -  When Hope is Pain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Fwa5S8WrNk)** - An unknown band with an un-released album. Which is a shame, because Ritual Sacrifice is an amalgamation of all the best elements of the classic ‚Äúbrutal‚Äù thrash bands like Gammacide, Num Skull, Morbid Saint, Demolition Hammer, etc. Visceral drumming, fast and somewhat technical riffing that often blurs the line between thrash and death metal.

**[Soziedad Alkoholika ‚Äì Ratas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8NdQeBtZ9s)** - One of the most important crossover thrash bands in Basque/Spanish history. Soziedad Alkoholika‚Äôs second album takes some 90s influences from bands like Crowbar and Pantera to make a fairly memorable and energetic album.

**[Speereth - Resistir √©s v√®ncer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN7mVb8EXdY)** - Similar to Soziedad Alkoholika, Speereth were their Catalonian peers playing a very Sepultura influenced crossover sound. 

**[Usurper ‚Äì Diabolisis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBGW6phbeXg)** - Pure Celtic Frost/Hellhammer worship. Completely out of place for its time and quite good at what it does.

**1996**

**[Abhorrent ‚Äì Start Point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyTvB217D-0)** - Unknown but fairly unique band from Chile that plays technical death/thrash in the vein of Sadus, Atheist and demo-era Cynic. Despite some of the song lengths, Abhorrent manage to craft a good debut that doesn‚Äôt excessively meander with hundreds of riffs thrown in.

**[Abigail ‚Äì Intercourse &amp; Lust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wis0eJqlotM)** - While Abigail‚Äôs beginnings were more rooted in pure black metal, Intercourse &amp; Lust is an unabashed black/thrash aural attack that assaults your senses. 

**[Agony ‚Äì Millenium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSnLVwZNd5I)** - One of the most revered Colombian thrash bands, Agony‚Äôs first album does not fit any particular mold. During many portions, the music is reminiscent of Sepultura‚Äôs Arise (some minor groove included), but the band is not scared of venturing in more deathy and crossover directions at times. The album length might detract enjoyment for some, but this is very well composed and refreshing thrash.


**[Aura Noir ‚Äì Black Thrash Attack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Fc8XoGtwI)** - A debut that is well steeped in the old sounds. Aura Noir came just before the small black/thrash trend explored and gave the world a decent dose of 80s black/thrash that borrows a little bit from different sources ‚Äì Slayer, Kreator, Bathory, Hellhammer. You can probably make a game with your friends of where each riff comes from.

**[Bewitched - Diabolical Desecration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dXMAJimv4)** - I suppose calling this just ‚Äúblack/thrash‚Äù is limiting, because it may be that ‚Äì but it‚Äôs so much more. Bewitched carve their own standing in the style by taking a healthy dose of trad influence, lifting so many riffs from classic metal like Judas Priest or Iron Maiden. The mix is a completely success.

**[Inquisitor - Walpurgis, Sabbath of Lust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKjHPD2lqsU)** - Dutch death/thrash with some of the most over the top vocals imaginable.
**[Witchburner ‚Äì Witchburner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0-kyU8lAao)** - Clocking in at 23 minutes, Witchburner‚Äôs debut sounds like a lost Kreator demo from 85. Not the most original sounding thing in the world but the passion that went behind this is notable (also check out the follow-up, Blasphemic Assault)

**[Wotan ‚Äì Tranquility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3Wy_OpQKVY)** - A bunch of demos in the mid 80s and suddenly a full length in 96. Wotan were supposedly meant to release one far earlier, but instead opted to drop it at a time when few or no one really cared for thrash. Kreator is the backbone of the musical formula here (and the odd Sodom/Destruction riff). It‚Äôs very competent, if a tad monotonous at times. This would work a lot better as an EP.

**1997**

**[Advocate ‚Äì World Without End](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=freT-d0r2nY)** - You look at the release date of this album and wonder ‚ÄúWhat if this came out in 1984?‚Äù. We don‚Äôt know, but what I do know if that Advocate‚Äôs only album is wonderful and somewhat thrashy take on classic 80s USPM. Take the faster and more aggressive sound of early Metallica and Exodus mixed with the soaring anthems of Omen, Attack and Manilla Road (to name a few) and you get this album. Extremely underrated and worthy of much more attention.

**[Anonymus ‚Äì Stress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtH4OOMtNkc)** - Excellent Quebec band that alternates between aggressive traditional thrash and crossover and with lyrics sung in French, English and Spanish. The sheer energy that emits from this record is incredibly infectious.

**[Deceased - Fearless Undead Machines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pPOp7lu0Hs)** - One of the most unique death/thrash bands. King Fowley has always loved traditional metal and has absolutely no qualms about fusing it into this album. Catchy and memorable.

**[Defleshed ‚Äì Under the Blade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDLdpwxZCOc)** - As the 90s advanced, a new microgenre was slowly forming. Traditional thrash was dead in the water and wasn‚Äôt touched with a ten foot pole other than some niche acts. However, a new generation of artists took on the heavier side of the genre (primarily Teutonic ones like Kreator/Sodom/Destruction) and made it more ‚Äúcontemporary‚Äù sounding ‚Äì i.e. aping Slaughter of the Soul. A few acts were decent (Darkane, Dimension Zero) and others not so much (everything else). I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily lump Defleshed in this category, but their sound undeniably had some melodic death sensibilities. Nonetheless, ‚ÄúUnder The Blade‚Äù will satisfy both more traditional death/thrash listeners and those who wanted a more modern take on the genre.


**[Destroyer 666 ‚Äì Unchain the Wolves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXbNkgw9Kb8)** - Their first and most unpolished album, but a blistering and somewhat epic take on a wide range of influences like Slayer, Bathory, Sodom, Destruction, Venom, etc.

**[Gehennah ‚Äì Decibel Rebel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYrkit3vES4)** - Gehennah are a band that don‚Äôt take themselves seriously and that‚Äôs ok. If you love short songs that sound like a punkier and blacker Motorhead, then this album is worth listening to ‚Äì but only if you love alcohol. 

**[Guillotine ‚Äì Under the Guillotine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUeISwgCRAM)** - Pretty certain the band name gives it away, but this is a Nocturnal Rites side project that pays tribute to Kreator, specifically the Endless Pain/PtK era. Not the most original but with a lot of passion behind it.

**[Graphic Violence ‚Äì Graphic Violence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktQC6K3mQZs)** - Some bands can be accused of jumping of bandwagons, more so those that came really late to the (thrash) party. That accusation can‚Äôt be levelled against Graphic Violence, whose one and only album is a pure balls to the wall thrash album not too dissimilar from Slayer, Evil Dead, Exodus, etc. 

**[Inferno ‚Äì Downtown Hades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnZUfZXDZHs)** - Another one of the small handful of Norwegian bands that came back to revive the black/thrash sound of old, although these guys sound like a blackened Motorhead to my ears.


**[Latzen - Kontzientzia ala infernua](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAe2I6YqD90)** - A Little known Basque band that is on the lighter side of the speed/thrash spectrum. Think early Helloween mixed with Metallica and this is result. In a sense, this somewhat feels like a great follow up to the Su Ta Gar debut since their later material strayed away really far from thrash.

**[Negarobo ‚Äì Emergency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_UJtZ9bs5g)** - Powerful and in your face Beneath the Remains era Sepultura worship. By far one of the greatest Japanese thrash bands in existence, Negarobo‚Äôs half-an hour debut never lets go of the aggression from beginning to end ‚Äì bringing in a certain hardcore punk quality into the music as well that makes it stand out from many of the releases mentioned here. 

**[Nocturnal Breed ‚Äì Aggressor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h6x_gv1XWo)** - Silenoz from Dimmu and Svartalv from Gehenna took a break from producing second wave Norwegian BM to produce this album that resembles their influences growing up ‚Äì Venom, Bathory, Tormentor, etc. Aside from misplaced keyboards, the black/thrash presented here is quite solid.

**[Witchtrap ‚Äì Necromancy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXioN6ku7Jw)** - Humble beginnings for the Colombian band, which produced a demo of noisy, yet enjoyable thrashy black/speed akin to early Sodom and Venom in a blender.

**1998**

**[Acutor ‚Äì Dios Ha Muerto]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoZjyYali94)** - Legends in the Bogota underground scene, Acutor‚Äôs one and only album sounds like a more controlled and cohesive version of the country‚Äôs early ‚Äúultra metal‚Äù bands like Parabellum or Reencarnacion. In other words, this a more structured take on early Sodom/Destruction with some South American touches that is more palatable to the average thrash fan. Recommended if you already love South American thrash.

**[Cranium ‚Äì Speed Metal Slaughter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l0Sz9P6bhA)** - Had Cranium‚Äôs debut popped 10 years later, it would have undoubtedly been crossed out as another dumb retro thrash album (given the toilet humour and shitty album art), missing out on what makes this such a fun affair. Cranium don‚Äôt take themselves seriously, something evident through the lyrical content and excessively shrill vocals. But Cranium actually do a great job at amplifying the speed metal elements to deliver a more melodic, yet still gritty take on the early German thrash scene.

**Crustacean ‚Äì Burden of Our Suffering** - No samples, but this is a fine debut of Slayer/Dark Angel/Demolition Hammer ‚Äúbrutal‚Äù thrash that delivers short, but in your face songs. Also not the peak of creativity but it hits the mark just right.

**[Deathwitch ‚Äì The Ultimate Death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkJCp48_Hro)** - A side project of the singer of Runemagick, Deathwitch is a great ode to 80s black/thrash ala Venom, Sodom, Sarcofago, Bathory, etc with a more updated and modern sounding production. **

**[Desaster ‚Äì Hellfire‚Äôs Dominion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nj3ewbMQu2c)** - Although Desaster fall firmly into the late 90s black/thrash revival, their approach is very different to their peers perhaps with the exception of D666. Sounding like a popurri of different 80s thrash (especially German) and first wave black metal acts, Desaster take this foundation to craft a more refined, galloping, folky and epic sound as opposed to just borrowing old riffs. The end result is an excellent effort that alternates between fast paced thrashier numbers and mid-paced bangers like the linked ‚ÄúTeutonic Steel‚Äù. 

**[Ritual Carnage ‚Äì The Highest Law](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MM465kNpQY)** - Just like Defleshed, Ritual Carnage arrived in the late 90s to deliver a brutal death/thrash assault taking the teutonic sound to an extreme conclusion. One of the best Japanese metal acts of all time.

**[Scepter ‚Äì I‚Äôm going to Hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mlhf9hqPMNQ)** - A thrashier (although still quite mid paced) version of early Celtic Frost/Hellhammer. Pretty much a better version of Usurper.

**[Trascendental ‚Äì Dimensions](https://xtreemmusic.bandcamp.com/album/nothingness)** - Absolutely killer proggy/technical death/thrash that is basically a thrashier version of Leprosy and Testimony of the Ancients. Get the Xtreem compilation that comes with this album and the debut as they are equally as good and one of Spain‚Äôs unsung heroes in the underground during the mid/late 90s.

**[Whiplash ‚Äì Thrashback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EL76f9kTEj8)** - Whiplash‚Äôs attempt to bring back thrash in the 90s with a decent ‚Äúcomeback album‚Äù (technically they had still been producing music, but it was groove metal boredom). As their band names might hint, this is fairly straightforward Kill Em All-era Metallica/early Megadeth style thrash that goes for a punchier approach to songwriting. Nothing groundbreaking, but still a decent listen (especially at the time).

**1999**

**[Dekapitator - We Will Destroy... You Will Obey!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ySPzX-XA9Q)** - Matt Harvey‚Äôs side project that delivered a serious dose of unrelenting thrash, taking inspiration from the heavier side of the genre like Slayer, Dark Angel, Sodom, Destruction, etc. 

**[Delirium Tremens -  Violent Mosh Ground](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIhYi_ypa2I)** - Fun and raw early Sodom/Destruction worship. Dumb lyrics, but overcome by the sheer conviction in its delivery.

**[Fatal Embrace -  The Ultimate Aggression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=td26y6vMjbo)** - Fun blend of different influences ‚Äì drawing from a wide pool of bands like Slayer, Exodus, Kreator, Sodom, etc. My only complaint here are the somewhat dull vocals and the meaningless Bonded by Blood cover at the end.


**[F.K.U. -  Metal Moshing Mad]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_P3CuO5C9U)** - Thrashy crossover not too dissimilar from S.O.D., including silly lyrics. It gets a bit tiring towards the end, but there are plenty of satiating riffs for thrash fanatics.

**[Hellstorm ‚Äì Fucking Bleed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pum92R7AZeA)** - Little known Swedish black/thrash act that suddenly released this album out of nowhere. You already know the deal, just pure filthy Sodom/Destruction worship all the way through.

**[Hypnosia -  Violent Intensity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZlQmI5SsI)** - Many are familiar with Hypnosia‚Äôs full length ‚ÄúExtreme Hatred‚Äù, which was a blistering and well-crafted album of early Kreator worship. Violent Intensity is the precursor to this album and is equally as good, delivering riff after riff of top tier Germanic thrash.

**[Invasion ‚Äì Conquered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PCVFKVyUWo)** - Absolutely repugnant and downright nasty death/thrash that invokes a deathier Kreator and even throws some South American sounds from Sarcofago/early Sepultura on top. At times it feels like I‚Äôm listening to a thrash version of Revenge. It‚Äôs only real sin is sometimes sounding too samey at times, but at its best, this is high quality intense thrash.


**[Sabbat ‚Äì Karisma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2bTVV4pnjI)** - Given their prolific discography, no doubt most people are at least familiar with some Sabbat. If not, prepare yourself for Engrish black/thrash. There is a punky undercurrent here, helped by Gezolucifer‚Äôs off the wall vocal delivery. Not for the faint of heart.

**[Sodom ‚Äì Code Red](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mGhgSQHcX0)** - It was hard to choose between this and Tapping the Vein, but Code Red arguably deserves more credit. Sodom‚Äôs mid 90s career consisted mostly of forgettable punky semi-thrash music, but here we get a return to form and continuing where Tapping the Vein left off. Incredibly hostile and in your face thrash metal with some DM touches. A great way to end the decade for such a legendary band.


**[Terror Squad -  The Wild Stream of Eternal Sin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNbqeo-p3TQ)** - Another Japanese band whose main source of inspiration is the Teutonic scene, but with the notable difference that they combine elements of Japanese hardcore into their formula ‚Äì most present in the vocal delivery. This is a frantic experience from beginning to end and will appeal to fans of both styles.



**[Testament ‚Äì The Gathering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gA9eDIWQTs)** ‚Äì I don‚Äôt consider myself the biggest Testament fan, but The Gathering is a great attempt at merging more ‚Äúmodern‚Äù styles with thrash. Make no mistake, this definitely has a lot of traces of 80s Testament, but retaining some of the deathier elements of Demonic and part of the groove of bands like Pantera. It‚Äôs a concoction that could have gone sour, but they make it work in part thanks to the amazing drum work present by Dave Lombardo and the rest of the ensemble cast (Steve Di Giorgio, James Murphy). Basically, this is the one Testament album to spin if you‚Äôre not a Testament fan.

They replied ""why?"". He explained that he was only 16. They in turn replied ""come to the back door"" where one of their security guys gave him a ""Media"" pass and let him watch the concert from side stage.

Status Update
By Dave Lombardo
Statement From Dave Lombardo Regarding Slayer Australian Tour 2013

I want to personally apologize to all of our fans in Australia who have bought tickets for the tour expecting to see me in my usual place on the drums.

So that you all know the truth, as of the end of the business day on February 14th, I was notified that I would not be drumming for the tour in Australia. I‚Äôm saddened, and to be honest I am shocked by the situation. 

Last year, I discovered 90% of Slayer‚Äôs tour income was being deducted as expenses including the professional fees paid to management, costing the band millions of dollars and leaving 10% or less to split amongst the four of us. In my opinion, this is not the way a band‚Äôs business should operate. I tried rectifying it by letting my band mates know, and Tom and I hired auditors to figure out what happened, but I was denied access to detailed information and the necessary back up documents. 

I spent the Christmas and New Year holidays realizing I had toured all over the world in 2012, but yet, had not been paid (except a small advance) or provided a proper accounting for a full year's sweat and blood. On top of this, I was told that I would not be paid until I signed a long form contract which gave me no written assurance of how much or on what basis management would deduct commissions, nor did it provide me access to the financial budgets or records for review. It also forbade me to do interviews or make statements having to do with the band, in effect a gagging order.

Last Monday, I sat down with Kerry and Tom to rehearse for Australia and to propose a new business model that I felt was the best way forward for Slayer to confidently protect itself so we could do what we do best . . . play for the fans. Kerry made it clear he wasn‚Äôt interested in making changes and said if I wanted to argue the point, he would find another drummer. On Thursday, I arrived at rehearsals at 1 pm as scheduled, but Kerry did not show. Rather, at 6:24 pm I received an email from the lawyers saying I was being replaced for the Australian dates.

I remain hopeful that we can resolve our issues. But once again, I sincerely apologize to all of our fans in Australia who spent their money expecting to see the 3 of us original Slayer members.
I look forward to seeing you in the future.

Sincerely,
Dave Lombardo"

After the first rehearsal for our upcoming tour of Australia, Kiddie suddenly felt unwell which continued throughout the night, and the next day he passed away peacefully in his sleep.

He was a fantastic Dad, husband, son, friend, but to us he was always ‚ÄòKiddie‚Äô, the same 17 year old Coventry kid whose drumming style and personality blew us away when he first walked into our rehearsal room 20+ years ago.

Kiddie enriched our lives, and the Bolt Thrower sound. He leaves a massive hole in the lives of everyone who knew him and will be very sorely missed by many.

147,Shreddit's Album of the Week: Judas Priest - Painkiller (1990) -- 25th Anniversary
148,"Last night, true metalheads and punks in the Birmingham scene showed tremendous support for what punk and metal is really about. Evil Army, who just finished their East Coast tour, was found to be in possession of stolen gear that belonged to the bassist of Sadistic Ritual (an incredible and young thrash/death metal band from Atlanta). Prior to the Birmingham show, they played Atlanta, where they borrowed equipment from another band Disfigurement. After Evil Army left, the Sadistic Ritual bassist saw that his gear was gone from the storage room. Word quickly spread to Birmingham, and the good people there saw that they were using the exact gear that was missing. The Birmingham scene took action and confronted Evil Army, who denied everything, when it was clear that they were borrowing gear in nearly every city and that this exactly matched the description of what was taken. The situation got nasty and Evil Army got the shit kicked out of them. 

Next, Aaron Kelly (roadie/merch for Evil Army) took to facebook to post this on the Evil Army [page](https://www.facebook.com/EvilArmyofficial?fref=ts)...
&gt; THAT WAS A BADASS TOUR. EVERY CITY WAS AWESOME. THE VENUES WERE PACKED OUT AND WE SOLD OUT OF MERCH BY THE TIME THE NEW ORLEANS SHOW WAS OVER. THANKS TO EVERY ONE FOR COMING OUT TO SUPPORT EVIL ARMY. WEST COAST TOUR COMING UP. WILL BE BIGGER AND BETTER. oh and just a ps. no one gives a shit about what the little people in ga are saying. everyone knows better than to believe their shit. no sweat off our backs and we r gonna keep on thrashn. 

and this...

&gt;who ever is saying evil army stole something needs to come to memphis and say it to our face. did you see our badass van and all our equipment?? WE dont need to steal we have everything we need. our new bass player was borrowing equipment AT EVERY SHOW AND WE ALSO HAVE A BASS RIG ON BACKORDER THAT IS PAID FOR SO THERE IS NO REASON TO STEAL FROM ANYONE. SO ALL U BITCHES TALKING SHIT GO FUCK URSELF AND KNOW UR FACTS BEFORE U START ACCUSING SHIT. LAST NITE IN BIRMINGHAM SOMEONE STOLE FROM US AND WE KICK SOME DUDES ASS OVER IT SO IT WONT BE A PROB DOING IT AGAIN.

The fact of the matter is that according to several witnesses, Evil Army did not ""kick some dudes ass"". In fact, they got the shit kicked out of them and they retreated into their van to run away. Also, taking back what is rightfully yours is not stealing. They were caught red handed and they are denying everything. 

This band is a bunch of junkies. Don't let them come to your city and steal from your locals in the future. Word is already quickly spreading and there has been a tremendous amount of support shown for the Atlanta locals who got fucked over. Organizers/bookers from all the way down south and all the way up to Canada have said that Evil Army is no longer welcome in their cities. The gear is now in the possession of friends in Birmingham and will be recovered shortly. 

Thank you to those who take a stand against this sort of behavior, especially thanks to the great people in Birmingham. You don't fuck over your own kind like this. 

Edit - Please upvote for visibility and spread the word on any relevant forums, pages, etc.

Edit 2 - Turns out Aaron Kelly is the merch girl I believe, not a member of the band. Also, some witnesses say that she threatened to shoot everyone before they retreated into their van (not sure if they actually possessed a gun or not). Fortunate that no innocent people were hurt by this psycho.

Edit 3 - Turns out the gear they actually borrowed during the show was Disfigurement's according to the Disfigurement singer. They must have gone into the storage room at the venue and taken the amp that belonged to Sadistic Ritual from that room.

Edit 4 - For your listening pleasure, [Sadistic Ritual - ""Hellish Mercenary"" 7 inch](http://borisrecords.bandcamp.com/album/hellish-mercenary-7)"

My best friend recently died of a overdose. We always went to metal shows together. It was our thing to do.

It would be nice to make a friend in town that also enjoys metal that would like to go to some shows together. If you live in the area and love metal as much as I do you can respond to this post or PM me. 

I'm 27. Male. Planning on seeing weedeater, elder, castle, and nightwish when they come through. I went to see obituary, tengger Calvary, morbid saint, and Amon Amarth/Goatwhore recently without him. I missed out on children of bodom, carcass, and slayer/anthrax because I had no one to go with.

222,"My son introduced me to reddit a few months ago and he said that I should make a post in r/metal asking for suggestions. I mostly listen to classical music (I like J.S. Bach and Vivaldi), and a little bit of jazz if I'm in the mood. What are some good bands or songs to get me introduced to metal? It should be noted that the only metal I've ever heard is the few songs my son has played for me at his house, and even he said those ""weren't the greatest representations of the genre."" So what are your favorite bands?

Edit: Wow, thanks for all the helpful comments! I've done a bit of searching online, and I've found a few new bands that I like. Some of these were suggested in the comments and others were found using the ""Map of Metal"" that was posted in the comments by halfhearted_skeptic, along with some Googling:

Nightwish: I like the symphonic sound that they have! The singer is very impressive.

Apocalyptica: This one was suggested a couple of times in the comments. I like that it's all cellos! Very interesting concepts. I've picked up a few ideas myself from listening to them.

Ne Obliviscaris: I love the long acoustic sections with the violin. The ""screamy"" vocals almost remind me of classic blues, though I prefer the higher-pitched screams to the lower ones.

Meshuggah: I actually didn't like this band very much, but I very much appreciate what they do with complex polyrhythms and time signatures.

The Human Abstract: They have some very cool sounding guitar melodies. The vocals are a bit much, but I feel like this particular band treats them more like a percussive instrument than actual singing, which is very interesting. I imagine it's a bit of an acquired taste.

T√Ωr: This was a very strange, but very fun band to listen to. The viking-esque chanting almost put me off at first but the guitar and vocal melodies were great!

Keep the suggestions coming everyone! I'm having fun! I might make another post giving detailed feedback on a few albums sometime later on.

I got to the final of a guitar contest at college this month, and just had the finals today. The finals was me and two other guys. One played a metal song, the other played a jazz song. I played Breaking Point by Parkway Drive.

Anyways, the person judging it clearly knew nothing about guitar, and let the jazz player win because the guy played ""one of her favourite songs"", and flat out stated that the guy that won had the least technical ability, but it was a *music* contest, and *metal songs have no contrast in dynamics and aren't musical, just noisy*. 

I don't think I should have won, I think the other metal guy, (don't know the name of the song he played, sorry) was the best as his technical ability and expression was the best, but saying those things about a genre she has obviously never opened up to and calling it not musical is controversial as fuck.

The dude then no-showed day 2, forcing someone to come to his house to make sure that the venue would be paid for the second day.  Some amazing and responsible attendees (specifically Kayla Pugh and Christopher Smith) saved the day and took over the fest, but it had to be changed to a free show.  Not one band who hadn‚Äôt been paid prior to day 2 made a dollar of their guarantee.

Today tickets for Black Sabbath's warm up gig in Birmingham, UK (One of only 2 dates with Tony Iommi) went on sale. Literally within a few minutes the gig was sold out, which I can understand, it's a big thing.

BUT..

Within minutes of the show selling out there were absolutely loads available on Viagogo, Ebay etc. (Some of which having been posted within minutes of the presale starting yesterday morning). These tickets are going for upwards of ¬£100 (Face value ¬£45).

Does anyone else think that it's shit like this is just plain wrong? Some of the tickets listed will possibly not even sell (I mean there's one there for ¬£400, come on!) Surely governments should crack down on this instead of on piracy? Artists must miss out on more revenue as a result of this black market of tickets.

TL;DR Sabbath tickets being bought to sell at a huge profit instead of going direct to fans who actually want to see the gig.

Well, the promoter that that was in charge of everything decided that he didn't make enough money from it and stole ALL the money from all of the bands that played last night. He had previously mentioned that this was his last big thing in Savannah and was then moving to New York. So common belief at the moment is that he grabbed the money, hopped on a bus to New York, then proceeded to delete his personal Facebook page, his 'Savannah Metal Punx' page and his promotional page 'Black Southern Death Cult'. 

Despite all of this Ringworm still played their (albeit shorter) set (they found out what happened right before they were supposed to start) and Eyehategod came out and played for about a hour and a half even knowing that they were not getting paid.

Welcome to the Summer Edition of the banned and restricted list. To summarize why we ban and restrict bands, and healthy subreddit has active moderation and leaving it up to reddit's upvote and downvote system creates an over presence of popular and well traveled bands and songs. Moderation promotes a diverse ecosystem that is sure to piss everyone off. The Restricted List was created last year as a way to not ban bands but slow their fucking roll in the subreddit. It also provided a great way to take old banned bands and give them new life in the sub. It is my hope in the future that the Restricted list is bigger than the banned list. Additionally, input from the community helps us shape what is seen and what is not. If you vehemently disagree with this process, I am sure a strongly worded and terse response will be enough to change our mind on a policy that has been widely praised by the community. Go ahead. Ill get you a pen. Without furthur ado please welcome the new additions. 

------

#Banned List: No Changes 

#Restricted List: Nile, Carcass, and Blind Guardian are now Restricted. 

-----

A rule of thumb for restricted is that the mods will remove any obvious and glaring popular songs from the band. If you wanted to be safe, go to last.fm, click on tracks, sort by all time and just forget the first two pages. For Blind Guardian being moved from banned to restricted, you can be sure we will investigate them for the violation of any of these songs.

302,"**Introduction**

There is always a lot of controversy and discussion with regards to when musical genres are at their peak and when exactly they decline. Different people will come with different answers. Some say NWOBHM was at its peak from 1979-1981 whilst others would stretch that period to 82 or even 83. The same logic applies to every other subgenre in metal. When it comes to death metal, the genre arguably began its golden age around 1989 which saw many legendary debuts/follow ups (Altars of Madness/Leprosy/Severed Survival/Consuming Impulse/etc). The end period is more difficult to discern, but in my mind it ended after 1993. The genre had reached its maximum commercial limit at this point. Several Earache acts had signed on to subsidiaries of bigger labels and it seemed for a brief moment that death metal might take off. Entombed's ""Wolverine Blues"" was being promoted with Marvel's characters and songs off Morbid Angel's Covenant appeared in [shitty horror films](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdR7ylLItoM). 

But by this point, the genre had become excessively saturated. Just like thrash, too many indistinguishable bands kept popping up, which bored audiences hungry for something new. The emerging second wave of Black Metal scene injected a lot of excitement into the extreme metal genre and many people drifted onto that. Others abandoned metal altogether and explored other genres of music (e.g. Karl Willetts got into D'n'B around this time). Many small and mid-sized acts began calling it a day seeing as how the scene was stagnant - bands like Autopsy, Atheist, Pestilence, Brutality, etc.

Was Death metal ""dead"" though? [Not really](http://i997.photobucket.com/albums/af93/hjersvik/Flyers/repulse_records_ad_1997_putrid_dysentery_zine_no2_screen_res.jpg). Many stalwarts continued to release great records in this period, like **Morbid Angel**, **Death**, **Dismember**, **Sinister**, **Incantation**, etc. It's just that because of the backlash, it was a very difficult period for any new band to gain any kind of recognition. There were still a number of labels dedicating themselves to releasing quality releases, such as Repulse Records (formerly Drowned Productions) or Wild Rags. After a few years of stagnation, death metal slowly emerged once more around 1998 as the big labels began once more to sign new death metal acts.

In hindsight, this forgotten era is not as bad as people make it out to be. As people got fed up with the early death metal sounds, this epoch was more characterized by its experimentation and branching out. Many of the bands featured here reflect that, playing very different styles of death metal such as death/doom, NYDM, ""melodic"" death metal (not the gothenburg sound), black/death metal or sometimes just playing traditional styles with a fresh take.

Not every release mentioned here is a ""forgotten classic"", but all are in mind at least good releases that are worth a spin. 

Some notes before you comment:

**One release per band**

**No compilations (that's why there is no Imprecation or Darkified)**

**Although it can be somewhat subjective, I don't want to include big bands in this list as I feel those are too obvious and most people are aware of them. These include, but are not limited to: Morbid Angel, Death, Sinister, Krisiun, Suffocation, Nile, Cryptopsy, Vader, etc**


**1994**


[**Timeghoul ‚Äì Panaramic Twilight**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDbAQRMG4zE) - Generally hailed as one of the forgotten relics of the early DM scene, TImeghoul were making out of worldly technical death metal that defied most of what was common at the time. Thanks to the power of the internet, their legacy has been revived but they still remain a tragically underrated band that should be mentioned in the same breath as Atheist, Cynic and other tech death bands of the day.

[**Infester ‚Äì To the Depths‚Ä¶In Degradation**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxpkqxoRNjM) - Infester were one of the first US bands to begin embracing black metal elements into the music. Their full length is NYDM ala Incantation sprinkled with synths and dual vocals that result in one of the most hellish listening experiences known to man. An absolute classic

[**Death Squad ‚Äì Into the Crypt**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l3fH3-N1Do) - An overlooked band from the Netherlands that played an amalgamation of the two broad styles that have always dominated the country ‚Äì crunchy, Celtic Frost guitar tone mixed with thrash tempos. At 26 minutes, the album is short and sweet.

[**Gorement ‚Äì The Ending Quest**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGZRSCZam8) - Sometimes bands defy their national sound. Gorement was one such band in the land of the HM2, opting more for a debut of mid-paced death metal that had more to do with Paradise Lost‚Äôs ‚ÄúGothic‚Äù than it ever did with Left Hand Path. Dark and brooding death metal of the best kind.

[**Uncanny ‚Äì Splenium for Nyktophobia**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD0mH44jjb4) - In 1994, Uncanny‚Äôs debut came at an important crosspoint. The traditional Stockholm sound was dying out and instead being replaced by the harmonized riffs in Gothenburg. This album represents both of best worlds, bringing together Entombed and At The Gates into a fantastic blend.

[**Sadistic Intent ‚Äì Resurrection**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RSXoazrnaI) - From the recesses of SoCal came Sadistic Intent, a band dead set on keeping faithful to the early sounds of Morbid Angel and 80s death metal. Mike Browning would be proud.

[**Hazael ‚Äì Thor**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-kc0JxwO4E) - If you want proof that Swedeath was essentially dead by 1994, look no further than the fact a Polish band released the best album of that style in this year ‚Äì defying their fellow countrymen who were more interested in the sounds from the Florida underground. Hazael‚Äôs take on the sound is the moodier and more atmospheric kind, sort of a marriage between Desultory and God Macabre. 

[**Doomstone -  Those Whom Satan Hath Joined**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_T16xZq24JU) - While King Fowley was still in Deceased, he kept himself busy participating in this quartet of musicians that somehow managed to blend death metal, doom and traditional heavy metal in one package. Sometimes reminiscent of Nunslaughter, sometimes Mercyful Fate, always great. It‚Äôs not strictly 100% DM, but does it matter?

[**Ahrimah ‚Äì Ain Soph Aur**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m005E-MmUNM) - A bizarre fusion between traditional death metal and 70s prog. Think less of Opeth and more of Morbid Angel with some long meandering Pink Floyd-esque passages and it summarises the nature of Ahrimah‚Äôs music fairly well.

[**Anathemized ‚Äì Disdain**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rxDRFyFG1g) - Dreamy, ethereal and doomy death metal that invokes a lot of elements from early Septic Flesh.

[**Sarcasm ‚Äì A Touch of the Burning Red Sunset**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbq9igB4QVc) - Sarcasm decided 3rd rate Autopsy worship wasn‚Äôt their thing and in their last demo went for a radical change in sound, one which was more reminiscent of fellow compatriots Dissection ‚Äì but in a much more atmospheric direction. 

[**Exoto ‚Äì Carnival of Souls**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ORZ2HOuQQ) - A more thrashy version of early Morbid Angel. Great stuff.

[**Discrucior - Mundus Subterraneus**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zq2bsaN4S0) - An Estonian band that decided to pay tribute to the early Paradise Lost demos. The production is fairly poor, but most definitely worth a listen if you enjoy the haunting sounds of early death/doom.

[**Charlie Christ ‚Äì Symphonies of Blasphemy**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKtHdsGg6g4) - Before Erik got involved in Decrepit Birth, he tried his hand in this absurdly named band which played a pretty decent technical take on the Florida sound. 

[**Conscious Rot ‚Äì The Soil**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mls7V7qEW94) - An obscure band from Lithuania, Conscious Rot were at the intersection of various styles ‚Äì Swedish, Finnish and American. It has the an early Death meets BOSS HM2 guitar sound with passages that sound straight out of God Macabre.

[**Cianide ‚Äì A Descent into Hell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6RS0UGiNkU) - From the home of Master, Cianide provided nothing but exceptionally heavy death/doom with loooow vocals. An absolute treat for those who love their death metal with a lot of Celtic Frost influences.


**1995**

[**Mortem ‚Äì Demon Tales**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LP0CW8aJK4) - As the old pioneers of the South American scene were withering away and become groove monkeys, Mortem was just getting started by unleashing their archaic death metal that brought about the best elements of Slayer, Possessed and Morbid Angel. Peruvians legends now and forever.

[**Abramelin ‚Äì Abramelin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq4yBeO00oU) - Aussie death metal of a high calibre, ridden with riffs for days on end.

[**Solemn ‚Äì Asaru Brethren**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYzQfP7bpnc) - Solemn were a little known band from Jersey that happened to share a rehearsing room with Incantation. This common thread translated into their sound as with ‚ÄúAsaru Brethren‚Äù, Solemn produced one of the earliest caverndeath releases ‚Äì largely indebted to the first two Incantation albums with its own touches. Extremely underrated. Their drummer even briefly played in Incantation and was the drummer for Deteriorot.

[**Septic Grave ‚Äì Caput Mortuum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leICQ4K7_bE) - One of the lesser bands that were playing a deathier take on the black/death sound of Unanimated/Sacramentum. Fairly good demo.

[**Disaffected ‚Äì Vast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtyPWE-fgU) - An extremely bizarre and progressive death metal album from Portugal. If you like early ATG, give this a go.

[**Mythos ‚Äì Pain Amplifier**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6mVyM_ubJw) - Mythos were from Finland, but opted not to play their country sound. Instead, Pain Amplifier is a either a death metal-influenced black metal album or a black metal-influenced death metal album depending on who you ask. Regardless, it‚Äôs great.

[**Morbius ‚Äì Alienchrist**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0hZmqc70lo) - Before Arghoslent, there was Morbius (seriously, their drummer played for them). Like most Virginia bands, there is a strong HM sensibility in Morbius‚Äôs take on the genre. The end result is almost like an American version of The Chasm (although not as good).   

[**Vomiturition ‚Äì A Leftover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps_Z2VHEQro) - The grooviest take of Finnish death metal possible. It‚Äôs got the Finndeath morbid melodies, but coupled with the mid-era Bolt Thrower groove. Not the pinnacle of the scene, but definitely way above what was available in 95.

[**Lepra ‚Äì Leprosos Satanicos**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfHV-t2HlWA) - A disgusting maelstrom of thrashy death/grind. Think Suffocation circa Human Waste era. The band released one album and vanished into thin air, as was typical of bands that era.

[**Agony ‚Äì Apocalyptic Dawning**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5J-y8pY_u4) - Quebec death metal from the mid 90s. Can you guess how this sounds? Very competent technical death metal. For fans of Crypstopsy, Atheist and Suffocation.

[**Necrotic Mutation ‚Äì The Realm of Human Illusion**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s4kcGdcQwo) - A small Quebec band that paid homage to Covenant-era Morbid Angel mixed with the technicality of Suffocation. Solid material.

[**Experiment Fear - Assuming the Godform**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZGm7whkoek) - Jeff Loomis was in this band at one point. Coming from the Midwest, Experiment Fear played a sort of fancier version of Deicide replete with multiple changes in time signature, but never being excessively flashy for the sake of it. 

[**Scum - Purple Dreams &amp; Magic Poems**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy5W-wwa4bQ) - Scum‚Äôs second album came in the midst of the decay of the Finnish death metal scene. As their fellow compatriots were departing further from death metal, Scum struck a nice balance to deliver a doomy tinged death metal release that would be the missing link between The Karehlian Isthmus and Tales of a Thousand Lakes. 

[**Succubus ‚Äì Destiny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OxF6XMJo4g) - Succubus‚Äôs 1995 EP brings together the technicality of Atheist/Cynic with the frostbitten and chilling sound of Sentenced‚Äôs North from Here. Not the best production in the world, but enough to enjoy the twists and turns of the music presented here.

[**R.U. Dead? ‚Äì Nothing Will be Forgiven**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxC7BKIST9Y) - Arguably the worst name ever, R.U.Dead? was founded from the remains of Poison (Ger). But rather than play black/thrash, R.U.Dead? practiced a very tech/proggy version of DM reminiscent of the first At The Gates album. Expect weird time signatures and abrupt changes of pace.

[**Uncreation ‚Äì Death to Humanity**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1zO0znzPZw) - A Spanish band that released a short EP of groovy NYDM worship. It‚Äôs sufficiently distinct to actually be discernible from among the hundreds of bands playing this style in this era.

[**Horgkomostropus -  Lugubre resurreccion**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJzyEoC3NGo) - Remember how I said Solemn were one of the first Caverndeath bands? So were Horgkomostropus, but the difference is that they were from Honduras ‚Äì one of the poorest Central American countries. The fact a band from this era could unleash such a fine piece of dark death metal is a testament to the dedication of the musicians behind this project. 

[**Lustful ‚Äì The Almighty Facets**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIxO2J-HwF8) - From Brazil, Lustful were a band that were typical DM for the time, very Morbid Angel/Deicide influenced. However, Lustful distinguished themselves from the pack by incorporating some of the old Minas Gerais sound of early Sepultura and Sarcofago to add in an extra kick. Not super revolutionary, but good enough for this list.

[**Symphony of Grief ‚Äì Our Blessed Conqueror**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vV0DRa_mkmk) - Symphony of Grief were one of the best signature bands from Wild Rags ‚Äì playing a style that merged Incantation NYDM with Disembowelement death/doom. Worth a spin.

[**Perpetual Doom ‚Äì Sorrow‚Äôs End**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LlbgFqR6PY) - Before Phil Lambonte was making awful music with All That Remains, he fronted a kind of quaint death metal band that brings together elements of Grave, Bolt Thrower and Carcass in a blender. Definitely better than anything he produced afterwards.

[**Ceremonium ‚Äì Into the Autumn Shade**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1lMQq4-WU8) - Yet another devastatingly heavy, grinding and crushing death/doom that will leave you a sombre mess.

[**November‚Äôs Doom - Amid Its Hallowed Mirth**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcJbXtppIsA) - November‚Äôs Doom are more known nowadays for incorporating 70s prog and more clean vocals into their brand of death/doom. However, in their debut, there are barely any signs of what was to come. In fact, this is pure early PL/Anathema worship of a very solid nature.

[**Dusk - Majestic Thou Art in Ruin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Px5FvVGNaac) - The type of slow, engulfing death/doom that will depress you. Dusk's death/doom leaves no room for optimism, it is simply a half hour debut of pure, tormented slow-paced death metal.


**1996**

[**Adramelech ‚Äì Psychotasia**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cg7hXvedc6o) - I consider this album the final hurrah of the original Finnish scene. By this point, all the bands in the scene had essentially split up or changed their sound drastically. Adramelech stuck to their guns, to deliver the sound which made Finland a haven for DM in the day ‚Äì dark, twisted melodies mixed with deep guttural growls and furious drumming.

[**Sacramentary Abolishment ‚Äì River of Corticone**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuLVM17UK8) - Before Vermin blessed us with his vocal delivery in Revenge, he was in this Canadian band that faithfully integrated doomy death and Blasphemy BM into a neat package. It has the chaotic solos and percussion, but mixed with slow and melodic passages. Very neat. 

[**Inquisitor -  Walpurgis, Sabbath of Lust**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKjHPD2lqsU) - Dutch death/thrash with some of the most over the top vocals heard by anyone. 

[**Damnation ‚Äì Rebel Souls**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQpR_mhqFFA) - For me, a lot of Polish DM falls into the trap of taking the Morbid Angel/Deicide sound and making it too faceless/dull without any identity. Damnation do follow this sound, but are much flashier, their percussion is tighter and songs take completely un-expected turns with the use of keyboards. The end experience is a very memorable death metal album.

[**Golem ‚Äì Eternity: The Weeping Horizons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRPth5EZy-Q) - A German band that tried to mesh the sounds of Necroticism and Heartwork into a neat package. Sometimes it feels like you‚Äôre listening to Heartwork 2.0, but I don‚Äôt feel this is a bad thing.

[**Fallen Christ ‚Äì Abduction Rituals**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6aURimODI0) - Have you ever wondered what Altars of Madness would sound like if it was more grindcore sounding and they added a pinch of black metal? This essentially encapsulates the sound of Fallen Christ‚Äôs only album, which features some of the best early David Vincent imitation and impeccable drumming from Alex Hernandez (former Immolation drummer). 

[**Rise ‚Äì Shadow of Ruins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okRuRLiiTUA) - A relatively unknown USDM band that played very competent Covenant-era Morbid Angel worship spliced with some Bolt Thrower groove on top. 

[**Fleshcrawl - Bloodsoul**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_HHXcu63BI) - In 1996, your best hope when it came to listening to a new Swedeath album was waiting for Fleshcrawl to drop a new full length (or listen to Dismember's brief attempts at death'n'roll/melodic death metal). While this sound was deader than dead in this era, Fleshcrawl never gave a shit and continued to deliver the punishing riffs of Grave, Dismember and Entombed to a small crowd of devoted Swedeath lovers.

[**Insatatinity ‚Äì Divine Decomposition**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2JRBP-Nzwk) - Insatanity were one of those early NYDM bands that took on a more dark atmosphere ‚Äì sort of Morpheus Descends meet Infester. The only drawback from this effort is that drags on too much. If it were an EP, it would be one of the most underrated pieces of 90s death metal.

[**Asgard ‚Äì To a Golden Age**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awYHfEYUQmk) - A French Unleashed, complete with the archetypal Viking themes on top.

[**Crimson Relic ‚Äì Purgatory‚Äôs Reign**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_pCnk5RtO0) - After the dissolution of Divine Eve, some of the members formed Crimson Relic whose objective was the same ‚Äì Pure, undistilled Celtic Frost worship of the death metal variation. If you‚Äôre already a fan of Asphyx, Obituary, Sempiternal Deathreign, etc, you will derive great pleasure from this effort.

[**Bloodstone ‚Äì Hour of the Gate**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKoEZjK9bl0) - Bloodstone were another drop in the mid 90s Swedish black/death scene. They tried to distinguish themselves through a more ‚Äúbrutal‚Äù approach with more emphasis on frenetic tempos and heavy use of percussion. 

[**Tempestas - Euphony of Contradictions**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBRWTN0vuqY) - In the mid 90s, Chuck Schuldiner continued to slowly depart from death metal with each successive release in a more heavy/progressive direction. Tempestas‚Äôs only debut is what would happen if we lived in alternative reality where Chuck busted out one more pure progressive/technical death metal album similar to Spiritual Healing/Human. Tempestas try to distinguish themselves through the use of keyboards and more creative solos, but the influence is undeniable. A good homage nonetheless.

[**Thorr‚Äôs Hammer ‚Äì Dommedagsnatt**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYWGiNLbmhs) - Cult demo in many circles. Thorr‚Äôs Hammer played some of the slow, gruesome and earth shattering death/doom coupled with a Norwegian female vocalist. The demo drags you through the darkest abysses of the genre and leaves you somewhat drained at the end of those +20 minutes.

[**Avernus ‚Äì Sadness**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eET6Q6U-iNo) - Barney Greenway soundalike fronts a gothic laden death metal ala early My Dying Bride/Anathema. If you can tolerate some occasional cheese in the form of melodramatic female vocals, this demo is certainly worth a listen.


**1997**

[**Decrepit ‚Äì Acrimonium**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiuniKio0Os) - Decrepit were an Ohio band with some members of Nunslaughter. Their early material was pure death metal, but by ‚ÄúAcrimonium‚Äù, they had pushed in a more black metal direction with the use of  dual growl/shrieking vocalists and liberal use of tremolo picking. A good listen for those who want a more mid-tempo Angelcorpse.

[**Pessimist ‚Äì Cult of the Initiated**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xejKNJkYuX0) - Cult legends in the underground, Pessimist were a technical death/thrash band that added some black metal sensibilities in the form of dual vocalists (growl/shriek). If you wanted to hear Brutality‚Äôs ‚ÄúScreams of Anguish‚Äù with a black metal touch, this album is for you.

[**Dominus - Unchaining the Ancients' Black Prophecies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R6aD3msmEk) - Chile has a great tradition of underground metal and Dominus was one of the country‚Äôs best kept secrets of the 90s. They were one of the first bands that took the Incantation formula and applied it to their brand of ferocious and brutal death metal.

[**Caducity ‚Äì Whirler of Fate**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_4uOgesGk) - A Belgian band that have always described themselves as ‚Äúepic death metal‚Äù and their debut shows this. You have your typical death metal passages mixed with soaring solos 

[**Shub Niggurath ‚Äì The Kinglike Celebration**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVQuRtlnkdE) Blackened death from the depths of Mexico. Essentially take the best elements of Morbid Angel with a more dark and occult vibe.

[**Violation ‚Äì Beyond the Graves**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZfCCEEP6GQ) - Violation‚Äôs debut was on the shitty Last Epitaph, but proved to be one of the hidden surprises of the label. Their sound can best be described as ‚Äúbrutal‚Äù melodic death metal, taking Hypocrisy‚Äôs mid-era sound (Peter T√§gtgren produced this) and made it even darker. 

[**A Mind Confused ‚Äì Anarchos**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrEs_YkhUQ) - The band formed before Kaamos. Fairly heavish melodic blackened death metal.

[**My Sovereign ‚Äì My Sovereign**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9Zf3rSjcZY) - A French act that only released one demo of dark and filthy atmospheric death metal of the Immolation/Incantation variety.

[**Centinex ‚Äì Reflections**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfiAs5pBMdI) - Everything about this release feels so emblematic of 1997. From the cheesy SNES cover to the blackened death metal sound present here. Centinex were always one of the laggards of the Swedish death metal scene and their albums always reflected the sounds of the time, but they arguably peaked in Reflections with their own take of Hypocrisy meets Dissection. It can get slightly repetitive in places, but hits the spot when you want your death metal with a succinct black metal touch.

[**Intestine Baalism ‚Äì An Anatomy of the Beast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFg-uURZaZ0) - As melodic death metal was flourishing, Intestine Baalism were one of the few bands that wanted to try their hands at it without abandoning the foundations of death metal. The vocals are guttural, the rhythm is frantic but the songs throughout the album are abundant in non-saccharine melodies that add to the overall atmosphere. Simply fantastic.

[**Maze of Torment ‚Äì The Force**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LStDNrt_jpo) - Maze of Torment are another of those Swedish acts that pumped out a ton of albums throughout the 90s/mid 00s but are seldom remembered. While ‚ÄúThe Force‚Äù is not necessarily revolutionary, it‚Äôs a pretty robust death/thrash effort which takes queues from the Gothenburg scene. It‚Äôs less In Flames and more Merciless‚Äôs ‚ÄúUnbound‚Äù.

[**Maleficarum ‚Äì Demo 97**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPkgSIkZRjs) - A very unknown Italian band that were playing a ‚Äúmelodic‚Äù death metal sound around the time of the Gothenburg explosion, but still firmly death metal with a doomy touch. One of the best demos from 1997.

[**Defleshed ‚Äì Under the Blade**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mulVYJmXckQ) - As the 90s advanced, a new microgenre was slowly forming. Traditional thrash was dead in the water and wasn‚Äôt touched with a ten foot pole other than some niche acts. However, a new generation of artists took on the heavier side of the genre (primarily Teutonic ones like Kreator/Sodom/Destruction) and made it more  ‚Äúcontemporary‚Äù sounding ‚Äì i.e. aping Slaughter of the Soul. A few acts were decent (Darkane, Dimension Zero) and others not so much (everything else). I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily lump Defleshed in this category, but their sound undeniably had some melodic death sensibilities. Nonetheless, ‚ÄúUnder The Blade‚Äù will satisfy both more traditional death/thrash listeners and those who wanted a more modern take on the genre.

[**Scenery - The Drowning Shadows of Mankind**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNLP7ZYYb5w) - Czech band that played technical death/thrash, sort of a hybrid between Coroner and Atheist.

[**Misery - Revel in Blasphemy**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya1ywSIj3Tw) - Poorly produced Aussie death metal that compensates with its distinct take on the Deicide school of death metal.

[**Deceased - Fearless Undead Machines**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pPOp7lu0Hs) - One of the most unique death/thrash bands. King Fowley has always loved traditional metal and has absolutely no qualms about fusing it into this album. Catchy and memorable.


**1998**

[**The Chasm ‚Äì Deathcult: Triumph for Eternity**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goYkjEZafl4) - The Chasm are underground darlings and for good reason. They are a band that fits no particular mold and songwriter Daniel Corchada is adept at bringing forth elements of death, thrash, heavy and black metal into an explosive package. Deathcult is an album where the cover says everything, as you are taken through a cosmic journey replete with beautiful solos and evocative doomy passages. 

[**Runemagick -  The Supreme Force of Eternity**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzgB3kry0Jk) - Runemagick‚Äôs debut was a much needed kick to the somewhat stale death metal scene of the 90s. They took the grinding and warlike sound of early Bolt Thrower, mixed with a keen sense of melody to deliver one hell of a debut. 

[**Soulburn -  Feeding on Angels**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQRgTfXkpgY) - As Asphyx was slowly withering away, Eric Daniels formed Soulburn to torment the world with more good old fashioned Celtic Frost influenced death metal. Martin Van Drunen may not be providing his vocal delivery here, but Soulburn stand on their own feet with exceptional songwriting and the guitar tone you know and love.

[**Anasarca ‚Äì Godmachine**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBHmtp5we4M) - One of those forgotten bands that decided to fuse several different styles into a single album. Throughout the course of Godmachine, we get FLDM, Stockholm death metal and even a tinge of Gothenburg. Not a bad experiment at all.

[**Appalling Spawn -  Freedom, Hope &amp; Fury (The Second Spawn)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Goh--JfWSZA) - The precursor to Lykathea Aflame who essentially deliver the same formula: brutal technical death metal with beautiful Middle Eastern melodies.

[**Ritual Carnage ‚Äì The Highest Law**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MM465kNpQY) - Just like Defleshed, Ritual Carnage arrived in the late 90s to deliver a brutal death/thrash assault taking the teutonic sound to an extreme conclusion.

[**Amorbital ‚Äì Invidia**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQpidlUeryg) - Essentially, a Czech version of Intestine Baalism. They can be best described as ‚Äúbrutal‚Äù melodic death metal. No syrupy melodies here.

[**Crucifixion ‚Äì Paths Less Taken**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyWwof76O5Y) - This one is pretty frustrating. Crucifixion started as a death/doom act in their debut, but the follow up is crushing NYDM ala Dawn of Possession. They still hold on to their old sound in their solos, which are reminiscent of those found in Paradise Lost‚Äôs ‚ÄúGothic‚Äù. So what‚Äôs the issue? The somewhat poor vocal delivery. If they got someone more characteristic of the style (think Craig Pillard-esque), this would be one of the best late 90s DM albums.

[**Decerebration ‚Äì Decerebration**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DN_WbjGZWo4) - Quebec brutality, but mixed together with melodic death metal. Imagine Suffocation incorporating riffs from Eucharist/early Dark Tranquillity and Decerebration‚Äôs debut would be the closest thing imaginable.

[**Engrave ‚Äì The Rebirth**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thLqeQpNCR8) - A bunch of dudes from Coffins Text and Sadistic Intent pay homage to 80s death/thrash ala Possessed and Slayer, albeit with a less demonic sound and more on the thrash side. 

[**Pentacle ‚Äì Rides the Moonstorm‚Ä¶**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RsM2vgHizQ) - A monolith in the Dutch scene, Pentacle always stuck to their convictions and just delivered pure, unadultered Celtic Frost worship (pretty much the default sound in the Dutch scene). Pentacle was a notch up thanks to their thrash influence which was evident by the fast tempo of most of the songs. 

[**Apophis ‚Äì Heliopolis**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKAv73tkyo) - As Nile was releasing their debut, so too was Apophis releasing their first full length which paid homage to Egyptian mythology. While Nile was firmly a brutal death metal sound, Apophis‚Äôs take on death metal was abundant in melody and memorable songwriting.

[**Arghoslent - Galloping Through the Battle Ruins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rYEgFTkMTI) - Arghoslent's debut demonstrates how to effectively embed traditional heavy metal ala Running Wild into your death metal without taking away the core sound. 

[**Dehumanized ‚Äì Prophecies Foretold**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZJgNIUswcg) - One of the premier NYDM bands at the end of the century. Dehumanized had all the traits of the genre ‚Äì the groove, the technicality, the low guttural vocals and the insane percussion. But unlike many of their peers, Dehumanized knew how to write memorable songs and not just +30 minute indistinguishable blastfests. Even if you dislike Suffo-inspired DM, I urge you to give this a listen.

[**Abhorrence ‚Äì Ascension...**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtAT58GkZkQ) - Brazilian death metal became a hotbed for demonic death metal of the Deicide school towards the mid/late 90s. Krisiun, Rebaellivn and Nephast were a few of the names. However, Abhorrence‚Äôs demo embodies what made the first two Deicide albums so legendary ‚Äì the straightforward, hammer-on riffs, set to sterile snare and relentless pedal blast beats and a guttural vocalist spewing blasphemies.

303,"Mid/late 90s death metal - a look into the ""dark ages"""
304,Metal Council Convenes To Discuss 'Metal Hand Sign' Abuse
305,"Anecdotal whinge ahead. As someone with a non-mainstream music taste (metal, obviously), I've gotten used to listening to music at parties and such that I wouldn't listen to by myself. I'm not just grumpily tolerating it, I honestly don't mind at all. If people legitimately enjoy the music they're putting on, then I support that and will probably even enjoy it (it's still music after all).

But this attitude is almost never reciprocated. I was at a party earlier (happy new year!), and the music ran out at one point. I suggested I put on some 'chilled out, ambient music'. Fully aware that the people around me detested metal, I was absolutely not about to put on metal. And yet,  I got skeptical looks, and was told that people wouldn't want to listen to my music, and a bit of a disagreement followed.

I am offended for two reasons. 

Firstly, why the hell not? People seem to tolerate listening to each other's music all the time, across a wide range of genres. Why is metal an exception?

Secondly, knowing metal wouldn't be tolerated, I wasn't even suggesting it (I actually had [this playlist](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=AL94UKMTqg-9CooUGF_EedWXgrb5ECULhl) in mind). And yet even though I described it as ambient and chilled out (my exact words), people assumed I was trying to sneakily get some metal in without them noticing (like they wouldn't!). So I'm insulted because my friends seem to think that I'm so socially unaware that I wouldn't accommodate their distaste of metal. 

This has happened several times with the same group, I really would have thought by now that they would know that I am capable of choosing music everyone will like (or at least tolerate). And it's not that I'm crap at choosing music, because they judge me when they don't even know what I'm going to put on yet! One time I was like 'hey, I'll put on the Fratellis, that'll be fun!', and I got the same reaction (No, don't put on your music!), because people didn't know who the Fratellis are even though they're happy fun pop rock. Similarly with the Butterfly Effect (ok, maybe they're a bit heavy), and Pixies, people just *assumed* it was going to be horrible melodic death metal, because they hadn't heard of them and they know that's what I'm into. This includes the above chillout playlist even though I had described it as basically the *opposite* of metal.

Though ideally I wish this wasn't an issue at all and I could just put my music on the same way everyone else does.

Why the intolerance?

Anyone have any similar stories to share?"
306,Why is tolerance of others' music tastes so skewed against metalheads?
307,R.I.P. Jon Lord :(
308,"&gt;There's something inside me

&gt;It's, it's coming out

&gt;I feel like killing you

&gt;Let loose the anger, held back too long

&gt;My blood runs cold 

&gt;Through my anatomy, dwells another being

&gt;Rooted in my cortex, a servant to its bidding 

&gt;Brutality now becomes my appetite

&gt;Violence is now a way of life

&gt;The sledge my tool to torture

&gt;As it pounds down on your forehead 

&gt;Eyes bulging from their sockets

&gt;With every swing of my mallet

&gt;I smash your fucking head in, until brains seep in

&gt;through the cracks, blood does leak

&gt;distorted beauty, catastrophe

&gt;Steaming slop, splattered all over me 

&gt;Lifeless body, slouching dead 

&gt;Lecherous abcess, where you once had a head

314,"Known by many for having punishing low end, strange rhythms, and off-kilter melodies, the Finnish death metal scene has been revered for years as one of the best around in the early '90s, and a fair amount of bands since then have incorporated its ""signature"" sound into their own. 
While not all of the bands from Finland in that time period ever actually sounded particularly similar or in-line with what people think of, there was a lot of amazing stuff out there, and this post will attempt to serve as an introduction to that scene.

Some starting notes: despite the fact that I did say that there wasn‚Äôt necessarily a particular Finnish death metal sound, when people think of that scene, they tend to think of what I described in the first paragraph, so that is what I‚Äôll be drawing comparisons to when I reference a band as having ‚Äúthe Finnish sound.‚Äù Additionally, I will be mentioning a lot of scene incest, as many members of these bands jumped around to many others within the scene; while this isn‚Äôt particularly useful information for a primer, I enjoy that sort of trivia greatly, so it will be included here where I deem it relevant. Finally, I want to say that  while I mostly focused on albums and EPs, almost all of these bands have good demos that are well worth getting, and most of them won‚Äôt be specifically mentioned here; that doesn‚Äôt mean that they‚Äôre not recommended, and you should hit all of them. 

I‚Äôm making an effort to post to official streams of as many of these as possible- in particular, bandcamp and Soundcloud pages. In cases where there is nothing, well, time to turn to discogs, YouTube, and Spotify!

**First-tier essentials:** These are the bands to hit if you've never listened to Finnish death metal. These aren't necessarily my favorites (though many are), but they're the most popular and influential albums from that scene. No particular order.

[Abhorrence:](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Abhorrence/688) One of the most influential bands ever to only exist for a single calendar year, Abhorrence released only two official releases before breaking up, with a split coming the year after. Their sound was a major kickstarter for the Finnish scene, and several of the earliest bands (including most notably Amorphis and Adramelech) covered songs from Abhorrence's 1990 self-titled EP and from their demo from the same year. Putrid, primitive, and with a horrifying atmosphere to rival any band on the planet, Abhorrence mixed relatively straightforward but devastating massive rhythmic assaults with the terrifying melodies and doom-laden passages that would come to define the Finnish death metal sound to many people. Recently reformed and put out a stellar live album from a performance in 2013 this year. After breaking up, members would go on to form and join bands such as Amorphis and Impaled Nazarene. Abhorrence is a personal favorite of mine in the scene, and a big influence as a fan of death metal and as a musician.

[Bandcamp](https://abhorrencefin.bandcamp.com/music)

[Sentenced:](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Sentenced/162) Even before moving away from death metal, Sentenced leaned more towards death metal's thrash roots and towards melodicism than many of their counterparts, with equal parts of the clotting atmosphere of Abhorrence or Funebre to the similarities in composition to be drawn to Dismember or Death. While they had already abandoned the signature sound of the Finnish scene by their second album, their debut and the demos before it are amazing. They're among the most famous of the Finnish death metal bands, along with Amorphis, though they shifted from death metal to melodic death metal and further afield over the years following their debut. The bass player and backing vocalist from their first album briefly provided the same roles for Impaled Nazarene as well- though he was only with them for a few years, he was on all of the best Impaled Nazarene material. 
Recommended listening: Shadows of the Past

[Amorphis:](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Amorphis/1) Originally an unrefined and vicious extension of primitive death metal along the lines of rhythm guitarist/vocalist Tomi Koivusaari‚Äôs previous band, Abhorrence, Amorphis rejected simple brutality and slowed to a crawl on their first full length, The Karelian Isthmus, featuring some of the foremost death/doom of the early '90s, Finnish or otherwise; sophisticated and massive, the album stands as their last release that would qualify for this primer aside from an EP that was original supposed to be released before the album ever came out (as a split with Incantation, though that never materialized). Art from their debut stands out as one of the few Miran Kim pieces featured on a death metal cover that wasn‚Äôt an Incantation album.  Later material would become increasingly progressive and almost immediately removed from death metal. Much of the band played together in a thrash band before forming Amorphis.
Recommended listening: The Karelian Isthmus, Privilege of Evil
[Bandcamp](https://relapsealumni.bandcamp.com/album/the-karelian-isthmus-privilege-of-evil)

[Convulse:](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Convulse/10449) One of the earliest Finnish bands to put out a full length. World Without God stands out as a codifier of the Finnish sound; bass heavy and with alternating heavy riffs and melodies, it's everything that the majority of the scene tried to be, and before almost everyone else to boot. The album is much more straightforward than what some of Convulse's contemporaries were attempting but no less the killer for it; while it‚Äôs not one that I‚Äôd rank among my favorites from the Finnish scene, it‚Äôs absolutely essential and still a fantastic listening experience. 
Recommended listening: World Without God
[Bandcamp](https://convulseband.bandcamp.com/)

[Demigod:](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Demigod/995) Skull crushing riffs with one of the heaviest rhythm sections from the scene, some of the best moments of gorgeous melody, and a mystical atmosphere that leaves most of their countrymen in the dust. Syncopated rhythms, sections of noxious crawling horror, faster melodic sections and trem lines, and some wonderfully soaring leads over the heavy rhythms that were laid down by the guitarists not playing any. Slumber of Sullen Eyes is truly a lesson in imparting grace into death metal, and is my personal favorite full length release to come from the amazing Finnish death metal scene, as well as my favorite album to ever be released featuring three guitarists. The drummer from Slumber of Sullen Eyes would later join Adramelech, recording some great material with them.

[Bandcamp](https://xtreemmusic.bandcamp.com/album/slumber-of-sullen-eyes)

[Depravity:](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Depravity/2909) Wretched, twisted, vile. Ripping solos, strange melody, infectious leads, and a wonderful spacey atmosphere. Depravity lived for far too short of a time, but in that time managed to put out some of the most interesting songs from the scene; the unusual and ethereal production on their material (likely as not a product of inexperience and a low budget rather than anything intentional) suits their catchy riffing and melodies extraordinarily well. In an interesting sidenote, half of the band went on to form various crappy folk metal and power metal bands years after Depravity initially dissolved.
Recommended listening: Silence of the Centuries (Compilation)

[Demilich:](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Demilich/250) One of the most absolutely bizarre bands to come from the Finnish death metal scene, Demilich remained an obscure favorite of only the most devout, hardcore death metal fans for many years until the internet caused a fortunate wave of interest in the band.  Far ahead of their time, Demilich was wonky and technical, with a completely unique vocalist you‚Äôll have to hear for yourself to believe. Currently reformed (though not for the first time- some of their best material was from a brief reformation in the mid-‚Äô00s) and playing gigs around the world, and doing it fantastically at that- I was fortunate enough to see them at California Deathfest last year and they killed it. 
Recommended listening: 20th Adversary of Emptiness (Compilation)
[Bandcamp](https://demilich.bandcamp.com/)

**Second tier classic bands:** Not as objectively important as the previously listed bands, but still all great. Some personal favorites here, and a good few bands broken up too soon. No particular order. This one is rooted in a mixture of personal preferences (which obscure bands do I include?) as well as with importance. 

[Adramelech:](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Adramelech/2426) While Adramelech didn't put out a full length until 1996, they were active from 1991 and put out two demos and an absolutely stellar EP by 1992. More technically proficient at times than most other early Finnish bands and with that same bent for the weird without ever forgetting that death metal is fundamentally an exercise in punishment and not one in showing off. They remain one of the more popular bands from that scene aside from ones that later strayed from death metal.  
Recommended listening: The Spring of Recovery, Psychostasia
[Bandcamp](https://xtreemmusic.bandcamp.com/album/psychostasia)

[Cartilage:](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Cartilage/3299) Strange mournful atmosphere, deranged and odd rhythms, and extreme variances in tempo make for one of my favorite bands from the Finnish death metal scene. Didn‚Äôt do much other than a couple of demos and a split, unfortunately, but that split is one of the best in death metal history entirely on the strength of Cartilage‚Äôs side of it.
Recommended listening: The Fragile Concept of Affection (expanded edition)
[Bandcamp](https://xtreemmusic.bandcamp.com/album/split-album-2-cd)

[Funebre:](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Funebre/9651) Another of the very earliest death metal bands to come out of Finland. Started off very straightforward and had started moving towards death metal insanity of a less straightforward variety with their debut before breaking up shortly thereafter. 
Recommended listening: Children of the Scorn
[Bandcamp](https://xtreemmusic.bandcamp.com/album/children-of-the-scorn-demos)

[Phlegethon:](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Phlegethon/4298) Extremely long winded death metal often leaning towards mystical thrash, with bizzarre rhythms constantly battling with inventive leads that keep any of their material from ever getting dull. Though they broke up and formed multiple times, they never managed to put out an album. Several members from Phlegethon would later go on to play in Hooded Menace.
Recommended listening: Drifting in the Crypt (compilation)

[Mordicus:](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Mordicus/12859) With a much more prominent bass and more melody than many of their counterparts, Mordicus stands out among most of the rest of the bands on this list as sounding less immediately in line with their peers; some fans call them Swedish death metal from Finland, and that‚Äôs not entirely far off.
Recommended listening: Dances From Left

[Agonized:](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Agonized/35083) Heavy, mid-paced, and rotting. Pummeling with the standard Finnish low end.
Recommended listening: Gods‚Ä¶
[Bandcamp](https://dunkelheitprod.bandcamp.com/album/gods-demo-91)

[Rippikoulu:](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Rippikoulu/18921) Some of the heaviest death/doom to ever be made, and a massive personal favorite of mine. Terrifyingly crushing, Rippikoulu is a wave of molten lava sweeping over you, monstrous and trudging.
Recommended listening: Musta seremonia
[Bandcamp](https://rippikoulu.bandcamp.com/album/musta-seremonia)

[Disgrace:](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Disgrace/9507) Groovy and nasty, Disgrace sounded more like Carcass than Abhorrence or Adramelech. Absolutely disgusting and incredibly fun stuff. Before passing away, the vocalist/guitarist featured on their early recordings left Disgrace and joined the legendary Xysma. 
Recommended listening: Debts of God, Grey Misery

[Purtenance:](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Purtenance/9283) Rotting, crushing death metal that shows a lot of what the Finnish scene was the best known for. Heavy bass presence, crushing trem lines, ripping fast sections and slow, doom laden ones; off kilter rhythms occasionally flirt with weird melodies, but for the most part this is one of the more straight forward bands from the scene as well as one of the first bands to be a part of it. After their dissolution in 1992, Purtenance‚Äôs former lead guitarist went on to briefly play with Convulse.
Recommended listening: Crown Waits the Immortal, Member of Immortal Damnation
[Bandcamp](https://xtreemmusic.bandcamp.com/album/member-of-immortal-damnation)

[Xysma:](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Xysma/2622) Increasingly weird goregrind. Started off with their earliest demo material as completely straight-played death/goregrind and with each release spiraled out of control. Wacky and insane, Xysma encapsulated a lot of the general attitude of a certain type of weird Finnish death metal band without really sounding like any of them, and strayed away from extreme metal as a band as the rest of the scene was starting to come together. 
Recommended listening: everything before and including the debut album

[Belial:](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Belial/716) Black/death notable not only for its quality but for having three members that were either a part of Impaled Nazarene or would soon be a part of Impaled Nazarene as of the recording of their debut. Regularly sliding from blasting fast changes to groovy, mid-paced, and repetitive, Belial felt as often like a heavy metal band playing at death metal as an actual extreme metal band, and it‚Äôs absolutely wonderful. 
Recommended listening: Never Again, Wisdom of Darkness

[Mythos:](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Mythos/5207) Shared a member with Belial. Mythos is a bit more black metal leaning than Belial, but is related enough and killer enough to be worth mentioning. Catchy and full of big trem riffs, Pain Amplifier is a testament to its name.
Recommended listening: Pain Amplifier

[Interment:](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Interment/21489) Cool and strange lead-heavy grooving death metal featuring a founding member from Funebre. One of my favorite bands from the scene to never release an album.
Recommended listening: Life Here After (compilation) 
[Bandcamp](https://undergoreproductions.bandcamp.com/album/interment-finland-life-here-after-ep-1991-undergore-production-old-school)

[Wings:](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Wings/16559) Though they didn‚Äôt endure long as a band (and even less time as a death metal one, abandoning the genre after their first EP to mixed success), Wings made incredibly catchy and driving death metal that strung together fairly disparate passages of high-paced and entertaining material along with sections of atmospheric and miserable ones, and the frequent tempo changes linked together only by the barest of transitions feels almost bipolar in the best of ways. Keyboards, sudden spoken word parts, and a desire to throw everything you know about death metal under the bus make you really wish that they had done more. Notably, two founding members started Wings from the ashes of Cartilage, who Wings sound very much like, and one of said members would go on to play in a string of extremely popular bands (some better than others).
Recommended listening: Thorns On Thy Oaken Throne

[Anguish:](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Anguish/21423): One of the earlier Finnish death metal bands to experiment with the standard death metal mold, Anguish were massive and hateful with some interesting ideas and twists on the genre ranging from the innovative, such as their idea of overlaying clean acoustic guitars over harsh death metal, to the merely odd, with a lot of stilted rhythms that sound years ahead of their time. Some sections speed up to be almostly absurdly faster than their slowest parts, and Anguish never let up on their fans for a second, whether playing slow or fast- everything is heavy, everything is powerful, and everything is great. Absolute travesty that they broke up after their first EP. 
Recommended listening: Ground Absorbs 

**Carrying the torch- the most important newer bands:** This section of bands from after the early/mid-‚Äô90s is a mixture of some of the more popular names in modern Finnish death metal as well as some of my own less-popular favorites. 

[Slugathor:](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Slugathor/4313) The shortest possible description of Slugathor is that they were Finland‚Äôs Bolt Thrower. Punishing staccato rhythms and fast melodic leads interplay, with most of the material being mid-paced and groovy variations on chugging or galloping low end riffs. Melodies range from Dismember to Demigod to Bolt Thrower, and fantastic drumming interplays well with the heavy rhythm section. One of the absolute best and most missed Finnish bands of the ‚Äò00s, though their legacy lives on in the many projects of their former members.
Recommended listening: Unleashing the Slugathron, Circle of Death, Echoes From Beneath
[Bandcamp](https://drakkar-productions-official.bandcamp.com/album/slugathor-echoes-from-beneath)

[Vorum:](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Vorum/3540278890) Hailing from the √Öland Islands, Vorum rely on a mixture of heavy Swedish and Finnish influences to crush, tremelo, and doom their listeners to death. Heavy syncopated rhythms, dissonant trem lines, big basswork, and an absolutely vicious vocalist make Vorum a great listening experience. Their vocalist/guitarist also currently plays bass for the savage Swedish giants Degial.
Recommended listening: Grim Death Awaits, Poisoned Void
[Bandcamp](https://vorum.bandcamp.com/)

[Stench of Decay:](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Stench_of_Decay/54432) Often fast, always aggressive, and riddled with cool melodies and harmonies, Stench of Decay is a driving beast that doesn‚Äôt do much new but delivers a depressingly sparse discography of incredibly catchy and memorable callbacks to Finland circa 1992. Deep and powerful vocals sink over heavy rhythms and leads, and a wide variety of songwriting keeps everything moving forward smoothly. 
Recommended listening: Stench of Decay (compilation)

[Hooded Menace:](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Hooded_Menace/112466) Originally started off as a death/doom take on the classic Candlemass songs- big riffs, big melodies, big vocals, all through the lens of a morbid lust for death and horror. Though the earlier material was a fairly straightforward take on that sound (albeit a fucking crushing one), in the last couple of years Hooded Menace has started incorporating a lot of the strangeness and long-form heavy melodies that some of the scene in Finland has been known for, trading plodding five minute crushers for ten minute epics. Incredible band, and a fairly prolific one, with four full lengths and a slew of splits and EPs since their formation in 2007, including a new split already out this year and another one coming soon! 
Recommended listening: Everything.
[Bandcamp](https://hoodedmenace.bandcamp.com/) 

[Claws:](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Claws/3540289123) One of the many projects that Lasse Pyykk√∂ has been involved in, and one of the few that he has embarked in entirely alone. Claws shares far more in common with Crematory than the classic sounds of the Finnish death metal scene, though Pyykk√∂ didn‚Äôt entirely forsake the melodic style of the Demigod and their ilk.
Recommended listening: Absorbed in the Nethervoid, The Funeral Barge
[Bandcamp](https://razorbackrecords.bandcamp.com/album/absorbed-in-the-nethervoid)

[Ascended:](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Ascended/116735) Ranging between slow, atmospheric, and chunky to blasting aggression, Ascended has a lot of great dissonant leads and layered guitarwork. Shares a member with Stench of Decay- Tommi, the vocalist, is SoD‚Äôs bassist. Definitely one of the more interesting and unique modern Finnish death metal bands, with a very personal take on the famous classic sound without feeling like a total clone of any particular band. It‚Äôs a real shame that they haven‚Äôt put anything out in years.
Recommended listening: The Art Of Necromancy, Temple of Dark Offerings
[Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/ascendeddeath)

**Newer bands, second-tier:** These bands are all killer and are some of my favorite running Finnish death metal bands, but are either not as popular or I just don‚Äôt like them quite as much as the first tier. A few inclusions are there as much because they put out an album this year that‚Äôs killer as because of any longer term listening preferences. 

[Desecresy:](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Desecresy/3540317587) Post-Slugathor. Absolutely killer and atmospheric doom-laden death metal that‚Äôs been pumping out albums fairly regularly since forming in 2009. Angular, eerie, and extremely consistent, Desecresy is oddly looked over by many people despite the quality of their music and the strong history of their bandmates. Though they were originally formed as a two piece, longtime vocalist Jarno Nurmi (Nowen, Serpent Ascending, ex-Slugathor) left the band in February and it is now the solo project of Tommi Gr√∂nqvist.

[Krypts:](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Krypts/3540282830) Propelled into the public eye by their first album, released in 2013 on Dark Descent Records, Krypts is one of the better-known current Finnish death metal bands, featuring a crushing low end, a fondness for doom, gloom, and thick production, and a cheerful simplicity that shows that they‚Äôre more than happy to destroy with reverb and atmosphere instead of with the fast leads of some similar groups. While they‚Äôre far from my favorite modern Finnish band (which isn‚Äôt at all knocking on them!), Krypts knows their audience, plays to it well, and make for a fun listen whenever you‚Äôre in the mood. A couple of years ago, Jukka Aho from Gorephilia joined in on guitars.
Recommended listening: Krypts, Unending Degradation, Remnants of Expansion
[Bandcamp](https://krypts.bandcamp.com/)

[Lantern:](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Lantern/3540255004) Strange, atmospheric, and with a lot of subtle layering and melodies, Lantern is one of the more compelling and ambitious of the recent Finnish death metal bands. They have a talent for lengthy and complex composition, a fantastic and multitalented drummer, and a willingness to sometimes completely abandon strange atmospheric sections to have periods of crushing death metal that sets them aside from many of their peers as a unique and captivating entity to be watched. Their new album is a fine addition to the Finnish tradition and to Dark Descent‚Äôs catalog.

[Bandcamp](https://darkdescentrecords.bandcamp.com/album/ii-morphosis)

[Gorephilia:](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Gorephilia/3540260934) Another Dark Descent band with a great new record this year, Gorephilia have evolved to eschew many of the trappings of Europe entirely to focus on powerful long-form Morbid Angel descended riffs, sounding like a primordial cousin to Sadistic Intent with only a few of the influences from Demigod or Abhorrence and proving once over that regional scenes, for all of the similarities that can pop up due to shared influences, are not an end-all to nailing down a band‚Äôs sound. Their first record was a bit more of a hodgepodge of Swedish, Finnish, and other influences, evoking Incantation, Demigod, and others more evenly. 
Recommended listening: Embodiment of Death, Severed Monolith
[Bandcamp](https://darkdescentrecords.bandcamp.com/album/severed-monolith)

[Skeletal:](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Skeletal/3540337514) Melodic, thrashing, and focused on relentless tremelo picked rhythms as much as on the chunkier ones that Finnish death metal tends to be better known for, Skeletal‚Äôs new album is a breakneck exercise in making death metal that‚Äôs extremely melodic without making melodeath. Short but fantastic solos pop up regularly and barked vocals work great with the tight instrumentation. Often more akin to early At The Gates or Pestilence than to anything historically associated with their countrymen. 
Recommended listening: Dreadful Life

As an end note, I‚Äôm well aware that this is missing a ton of stuff. It‚Äôs only meant to be a primer, filtered through my own personal biases and taste, and thus is missing hundreds of bands that could fit, even only counting the unmentioned side projects of many of the bands featured in this brief introduction to Finnish death metal.

342,"This is a public announcement post for anyone confused what NBBMN means. As far as I know, the thing came from /mu/ where a bunch of people decide to listen to black metal all of November. This usually ends up with people burning themselves out on the same Burzum or Darkthrone albums if you are not used to listening to black metal for 30 days. As much as I like musical themes in a time period, the whole idea of NBBMN sort of masquerades itself as a stunt rather than a meaningful exploration of music. Still though if people were looking for music to dig into or for anyone else interested, this thread is for RECS from the community regarding 2017 releases. Below I have collected things from my blog [Tape Wyrm](http://tapewyrmmetal.com/) and from [private Facebook chats](https://i.imgur.com/vCBqoWL.jpg) were we send each other bandcamp links. All of them will be lesser known so at the end of November you can impress one or two people probally on the internet.

358,"Hey Guys! This is what we're going to accomplish for 
SLAYER DAY!"
359,"25 years ago today, Fantoft Stave Church was razed by Varg Vikernes"
360,"For background, my main listening genres are: Hip-Hop and derived genres (ofc), IDM, Chiptunes/Demoscene and Roots Music. When it comes to hip-hop I've been getting into a lot more derived music lately like trip-hop (Nightmares On Wax, Sneaker Pimps), experimental hip-hop (Flying Lotus, some Chrome Sparks stuff, following Kanye obsessively since Yeezus), and instrumental stuff (Fat Jon, Nujabes, J Dilla, etc.). On the more lyrical side I've listened mostly to Kanye West, Kendrick Lamar, Lupe Fiasco, Pigeon John, Spit Syndicate, Jedi Mind Tricks, and a lot of assorted underground artists.

Onto the main event; I was looking at blacklist stuff to start with, and narrowed it down to *Metallica*, *Iron Maiden*, and *Opeth.* I chose Opeth because I knew the least about them, and I felt adventurous. So I pulled up ""Blackwater Park"" on Google Play All-Access (Spotify basically) and started listening.

First song thoughts:

Pre-Start: Wow, metal songs are long. I'm seeing like, 5-10 minute songs here. Are they all like this? I thought Joe Budden (rapper) was ballsy for having *one* 10 minute long song. Damn.

The Leper Affinity:
&gt;(0:00) - OH GOD OH GOD WHAT IS HAPPENING. There‚Äôs this ‚Äúdread chord‚Äù type sound playing and it won‚Äôt stop getting louder I‚Äôm scared maybe I should turn down my head-

&gt;(0:29) SHIT, that's loud. 
		
&gt;(0:30) I‚Äôm liking the sound of this. The vocals come in, and I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised. The vocals aren‚Äôt necessarily harsh or grating. Then again, one of the most vocally grating bands I have listened to ‚Äúregularly‚Äù (moderately listened to Pandora station) is Every Time I Die. I was told they were ‚Äúmathcore‚Äù or something though. This is also produced/mastered pretty well.
		
&gt;(1:25) I don‚Äôt really understand what‚Äôs happening, but I like it. I‚Äôm going to turn the volume up. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm supposed to do right? I‚Äôve got Hifiman HE-400s. They can handle this.
		
&gt;(3:17) It‚Äôs kinda weird being only a third of the way through the song at this point, but on the other hand I don‚Äôt feel like the song *should* be over.
		
&gt;(4:15) I‚Äôm loving the instrumental breaks. I‚Äôve always likened metal to a sort of ‚Äúclassical, technical mentality‚Äù+hard rock kind of sound from what little I had heard from it. I‚Äôm definitely getting that vibe, but it doesn‚Äôt feel over done or pretentious. This is really good.
		
&gt;(4:48) Holy shit I had to pause. There‚Äôs actual singing happening here. I wasn‚Äôt expecting that after the growling. It‚Äôs pretty awesome though, this guy is a great vocalist, and I love the acoustic-sounding guitar interlude he‚Äôs singing over.
		
&gt;(5:39) This phrase feels so strong, so moving, I‚Äôm getting the feeling of being in a strange place, and something serious is going down. Like, people are dying. Then again, this is called ‚ÄúThe Leper Affinity‚Äù.
		
&gt;(8:24) The layering of instruments that‚Äôs happening here is fucking amazing. 
		
&gt;(9:00) Dat piano tho. Things are calming down. Maybe ‚ÄúI"", or whoever can stop running, maybe I‚Äôm falling asleep. I picture a kind of grey, cell-like room. Comfortable, cozy but still a sense of dread. Wait. Am I dying? Fuck, I better not be dying.

Next up, ""Bleak"", in the comments."
361,"So I saw the old ""Hip-Hop Head listening to metal"" threads, and thought I'd try my hand at it. Little experience with it, trying Opeth's ""Blackwater Park"" Album."

363,I was watching The Inbetweeners and saw this in the background.

365,"Months ago I was seeing a few bands at my towns ""metal festival"" which is more of a bunch of local metal bands getting together and playing a small venue (barely bigger than a bar) for 3 nights straight. Show was going great on the final night when some asshole decided to shove all the people on the sides into the pit. Here's where I have a problem, a few months prior to the show I fell off of a loader(think big bulldozer with wheels) I was climbing into for work and hurt my back. Well when this prick drug me into the pit people pushed me all around and I felt a pop in my back and an immediate surge of pain. Had to struggle my way out of the pit and drive home 45 minutes away because of the intense pain. CUTTING my experience short. The next day the dr told me to keep off of it for a few weeks. So now not only did I miss out on an amazing show but also on the income from a total of 3 weeks of work. So, to conclude
DONT BE AN ASSHOLE IN THE PIT. If people aren't in it, then maybe they don't want to be drug into it. Or in my case they can't be. "
366,To the asshole in the pit
367,"Obviously the nominations weren't particularly great (I would have given it to Mastodon personally), but giving a Grammy for a generic cover of a song from 1984 is just ridiculous."

Well, last night that changed. Skeletonwitch killed it, Enslaved killed it, and Amon Amarth brutally murderized it. It was fucking insane, and I loved every second of being in the pit to helping those ballsy enough to go crowd surfing.

Everything I've been told about the metal community rang true last night. The few times that I slipped and fell on my ass, three dudes were there to pull me back up and toss me back in the pit. Everyone was nice as hell, I struck up conversation and joked around with everyone around me.

I know you guys probably already knew all of this, but I had to share my experience, because it was fucking amazing. I already bought tickets to Children of Bodom and Behemoth, and if you're in the Houston area, I'll see you in the pit. "

377,"Starting with the late 60's and early 70's, the Japanese were absorbing the hard rock and folk rock happening in the West and releasing somewhat unique takes on it. This continued through the rest of the 70's until Japan become a common Asian fixture among big world tours towards the end of the 70's. Scorpions, Judas Priest and Van Halen played there to sold out crowds, and you can only bet there was an entire scene full of bands inspired by these that developed soon.  
  
Most of these bands take influences from several Western bands and form a weird melting pot for all these different sounds to coexist in a single album or even a single song. Of course, they also added their own flavor to the music and the fact that almost all of them sang in Japanese helps their ""unique"" factor as a scene. While not as prolific as the UK, the US, France, Germany or Sweden, there are more than a few absolute gems to be found in this scene.  
  
There were two major scenes in Japan in the 80's. Kansai and Kanto. The ""Kansai"" scene was centered around Osaka in the west of Japan and was already established by the time 1980 came around. Influenced initially by mostly 70's Western bands, the Kansai bands were bluesy, melodic and more straight forward in their approach to the Heavy Metal sound. On the other hand the ""Kanto"" scene was centered around Tokyo in the east of Japan and formed a few years later. Influenced by later bands and also Visual Kei and other Japanese phenomena, these bands were more weird, proggy and ""interesting"" in their approach to Heavy Metal.  
  
Note #1: 1st tier bands are not necessarily better than the 2nd tier or 3rd tier bands. Some of my favorites are listed here as 2nd tier bands. The tiers are related to popularity/influence and nothing else.  
Note #2: Only bands that released at least one EP or one full length some time during the 80's.  
  

**1st Tier: The More Influential**  
  
[**X Japan**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ovAk5avdzE)  
Definitely the most popular metal band out of Japan, this is one band I'm sure most you are already familiar with. In line with most bands from the Kanto scene, they  incorporated non-traditional elements to their brand of Heavy Metal. You'll find a major scale ballad sandwiched between two Speed Metal songs only on an X Japan album. Of course this proggy tendency got more obvious later on starting with the ""Art of Life"" album. Initially, they were more straightforward and wrote absolutely killer, fist-pumping stuff that's not too far, musically, from Helloween at their best.  
Recommended listening: Vanishing Vision, Blue Blood  
  
[**Loudness**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2IXfiYD_Fc)  
Another band most of you will be familiar with, Loudness formed from the ashes of rock band ""Lazy"" in 1981. Disappointed with the musical direction of Lazy and wanting to go in a heavier direction, they were still very hard rock influenced initially. With every album, however, the hard rock influence was stripped away. By the third album, the hard rock influence was gone, leaving us with some killer melodic heavy metal. They also became the first Japanese band to tour the US in '83 for this very album. After the third album, they went in a more commercial, accessible direction, but never compromised on the quality. Overall, a pretty consistent discography and you can't really go wrong with at least most of their 80's output.  
Recommended listening: The Law of Devil's Land, Disillusion, Thunder in the East  
  
[**Earthshaker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZTps-z7ZD0)  
Formed in 1978, they were one of the earlier bands on the scene. As is obvious from the name, a Y&amp;T song, they were initially grounded in 70's Hard Rock/Heavy Metal. Also absorbing the stylings of certain NWOBHM acts that formed around the same time, their first album, released in 1983, is a pretty good slab of early Heavy Metal. It also has a song written by a certain Adrian Smith. After this, they started getting more commercial-sounding with every release. Their second album, which I prefer, was a nice middle ground, featuring some great melodic heavy metal and also more pop-influenced stuff. After this, the pop influenced got to a point which made them unlistenable. The first two, however, are great and worthy listens.  
Recommended listening: s/t, Fugitive  
  
[**Anthem**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PT_IR1K-d0)  
Another band that gained a lot of popularity outside Japan, Anthem formed the same year Loudness did but in the Kanto region and would take way longer to release a full length. More straightforward riffs and songwriting, unlike their Kanto counterparts, they would prove to be very influential to the more weird bands that would form in the area. The s/t debut came 4 years after they had formed, but what a phenomenal release that was. Stock full of fast, catchy riffs with layered vocals that you know you can't stop listening to once you start. They never really changed their sound drastically, keeping the same formula that had worked for them on the s/t album. But even then, the quality never really dropped. Theirs is as consistent a discography as you're gonna get from Japan.  
Recommended listening: s/t, Tightrope, Gypsy Ways, Hunting Time  
  
[**Bow Wow**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA0mBuBPc0A)  
The first of the Kanto bands (after Flower Travellin' Band), Bow Wow formed in 1975, playing stuff that sounded like a variety of different bands. From Black Sabbath to the Beatles, these guys drew influence from the entire spectrum of rock music available at the time. Nothing too original, at least initially, but still killer. They released quite a lot of stuff over the course of the 80's, some of which was under a different name (Vow Wow). Of all the 12 albums they did release in the decade, ""Warning from Stardust"" has got to be my favorite. The riffs are catchy as all hell, at times very bluesy. Most of the rest of their 80's output is also pretty good, but nothing too original or groundbreaking. 
Recommended listening: Asian Volcano, Warning from Stardust, Vow Wow III  
  
[**44 Magnum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCMNBtMKgAs)  
One of the first Kansai bands, having formed in 1977, 44 Magnum played stuff that was pretty similar to what Bow Wow and Loudness were doing early on, with more Scorpions influence. First EP and first two full lengths are pretty solid, after which they went in a more AOR direction.  
Recommended listening: s/t EP, Danger, Street Rock'n Roller  
  
[**Sabbrabells**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nBpGmPLwi8)  
Some of you may remember these guys from ""One Night Magic"" being album of the week a couple of weeks back. Sabbrabells are one of the more unique bands you're gonna find from this scene, and they build on influence from Mercyful Fate primarily. Sometimes slow, sometimes fast, always vicious. Also fascinated with the occult, which showed up in their lyrical matter and on-stage costumes, they were the closest Japan came to having a Mercyful Fate of their own. Strange, weird, extremely fun band with no bad releases. Too bad they split up in 1987, after just 6 years of being almost perfect. They're back now, however, and we can only hope for some new material. Till then, we've got their excellent 80's output.  
Recommended listening: s/t, Dog Fight EP, One Night Magic  
  
[**X-Ray**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XSM8_8mvbw)  
Another straight forward, hard rock influenced band from Osaka, their first two albums are a clueless, weird mishmash of different influences. The second album is better than the first but not by much, and has an interesting cover. The first half of said album is pretty good, and I'd draw similarities to early Riot, but the second half drags on and features a strange cover of a certain Twisted Sister song. Third and fourth albums are much more refined and have a certain musical direction. Adding a keyboardist, they took the anthemic heavy metal route and it totally worked for them. Killer stuff that is similar to what Loudness were doing at the time. They sadly split up after this though.

[**ËÅñÈ£¢È≠îII (Seikima-II)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8oHV2I8NZ8)  
Kanto band that formed in 1982, and took 3 years to release their killer debut. More unique, in line with other Kanto bands, the riffs are absolutely monstrous and the vocals are no less. The second album is my favorite of theirs. Pretty much a no-filler record, the title song ""The End of the Century"" is probably my favorite song from this entire scene. Absolutely killer album, and a good place to stop unless you want to listen to excessive prog rock influence in which case ""The Outer Mission"" might work for you.   
Recommended listening: ÊÇ™È≠î„ÅåÊù•„Åü„Çä„Å¶„Éò„É¥„Ç£„É°„Çø„Çã, The End of the Century  
  
[**Flatbacker and EZO**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWwxNf6oOH0)  
Started out in 1982 as Flatbacker, they were initially very raw and menacing. Featuring twin guitar harmonies and the whole early 80's Heavy Metal package. The demo and both the full lengths under the ""Flatbacker"" name are all good. The name change happened in 1986, after which they moved to the US and gained moderate popularity and shifted to a more commercial sound. Their first full length under the ""EZO"" name was produced by a certain Gene Simmons. It came a little late, in 1987 when thrash metal was big, but it is certainly a solid album worth checking out. Musically similar to the glam bands of the time, and almost as good. The second album was musically a little better but proved to be sort of a financial disaster at a time when glam was dying, and they had to disband soon after.  
Recommended listening: Esa, E-Z-O, Fire Fire  
  
[**Dead End**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3pY4PWGiz4)  
These guys formed a little later as compared to the other 1st tier bands, in 1984. Their debut, which came out in 1986, was a pretty killer Speed Metal album. Lots of similarities to ""Restless and Wild""-era Accept, down to the aggressive vocals. They gained a lot of popularity from touring in Japan, and built quite a legacy for themselves during the 80's, releasing three more albums in the process. The last of these three was a pop rock album but the other two are solid Speed Metal albums. Soon after, in 1990, they disbanded.  
Recommended listening: Dead Line, Ghost of Romance  
  
  
**2ND Tier: The Less Influential**  
  
  
[**Terra Rosa**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfDhAK13CHs)  
One of the earlier bands on the scene, Terra Rosa were part of both the Kansai and Kanto scenes at different times. Their best work, the debut album, came when they were still a part of the Kansai scene earlier on. An absolute gem of no filler, Rainbow-influenced riffs with a unique flavor. Very tastefully done keyboards are an icing on the cake. After this album though, they became a melodic rock band. So, the debut is both a great place to start and an even better place to stop.  
Recommended listening: The Endless Basis  
  
[**Action!**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p4ycI-HQ0Y)  
Another earlier band that didn't really get big. A variety of different influences manifest themselves throughout any given Action! album . A song with mid-paced Heavy Metal riffing and vicious vocals with harmonized choruses, followed by a song full of Zeppelin riffs, followed by some other bluesy shit back to mid-paced Heavy Metal. Most of their albums are at least solid though and totally worth checking out.  
Recommended Listening: Hot Rox, Heart Raiser, Warning in the Night  
  
[**Reaction**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQanNlLUkCo)  
Flowing nicely, name-wise, from the above band are one of the pioneers of the Kanto scene with Anthem, Bow Wow and Sabbrabells. Reaction never got as big as those, but were equally killer. Featuring fast, melodic riffs and catchy songwriting overall, there are some parallels to be drawn to lighter USPM acts like Fifth Angel, Hittman and Leatherwolf. They got better with each release until their third, which is my favorite out of their catalogue. The fourth, s/t album is pretty solid too, and a great place to stop. What followed is a mediocre cock rock effort that's a total waste of time. At their best, though, Reaction were the Speed Metal band to beat in Japan.  
Recommended Listening: Insane, Agitator, True Imitation  
  
[**Show-Ya**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqQFeTyGNlo)  
All-girl band that formed early on in 1982, influenced by classic rock and hard rock initially. They would go on to achieve lots of fame all through the 80's, of course kick-started by that Coca-Cola ad. Seeing how glam bands were getting huge, Show-Ya changed stylistically to fit in and also had AOR influence. They ended the 80's on an extremely high note with what is my favorite of all their albums, Outerlimits.  
Recommended listening: Queendom, Outerlimits  
  
[**Sniper**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm22DmbGu6U)  
Also an earlier band, Sniper formed in 1981 and released two, straightforward fun albums before eventually disbanding. Much like Saxon and early Rainbow in the type of Heavy Metal they made, the first album features some killer riffing. Second album ranges from solid to good.  
Recommended listening: Open the Attack, Quick &amp; Dead  
  
[**Bellzlleb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvrda6tsaUw)  
Excellent Doom-laden Heavy Metal initially, full of feelings of despair built on strong riffs. The vocalist, Rei, sounds like he's absolutely mentally disturbed. Makes for some wholesome listening.  
Recommended listening: s/t  
  
[**Blizard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAlQFMFNtnI)  
These guys wouldn't be too out of place on the Sunset Strip, with their brand of Heavy Metal. Straightforward and borrowing a lot from the glam bands of the time, these guys lacked the ""oomph"" of Motley Crue or Dokken and faded into obscurity after they disbanded in 1992. All that being said, the stuff on their first three albums is pretty solid and catchy.  
Recommended listening: Kamikaze Killers, Hot Shot!  
  
[**Wolf**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTvs3001QCs)  
Perhaps my favorite band from this scene. The s/t EP from 1987 is one of the strongest releases from this scene. Featuring USPM-like riffing, vicious high-pitched vocals and some catchy-ass songwriting, this is some obsession worthy stuff that I've listened to endlessly since I first heard it. The demo from the same year and the single released later on are solid as well.  
Recommended listening: s/t EP  
  
[**Hellen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHw7SW6oEhc)  
Another favorite of mine, these guys would only release one EP (besides a couple of singles and a demo) before eventually disbanding. The EP ""Talon of King"" is as good if not better than the Wolf EP. Featuring some Power Metal-esque riffs and melodic passages with some neoclassical influence and some top-notch guitar work, this is a total gem of an EP. Fair warning: there is a lot of keyboard involvement here. All tastefully done, of course, but you might want to tread lightly if you're totally averse to keyboards in your Heavy Metal.  
Recommended listening: Talon of King  
  
[**Genocide**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8brQL5KvyM)  
One of the earliest bands in the scene, having formed in 1979, they would go on to release just the one full length. But man, what a release. Absolutely heavy riffing, sometimes venturing into doom territory but not much. The vocalist is an absolute treat, with his extra high-pitched vocals which can get a little too much sometimes but nothing a great riff won't come in and solve immediately. The full length also has a nice acoustic song that doesn't at all feel cheesy and totally fits in with the rest of the album.  
Recommended listening: Black Sanctuary  
  
[**Crowley**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDQK7sQA9Es)  
Another pretty unique band, featuring some epic riffing and almost operatic vocals. Their fascination with occult themes led to them gaining some traction in Europe and they were set to tour there before some line-up problems halted that. They eventually disbanded in the late 80's, leaving us with a killer EP and even more killer full length.  
Recommended listening: The Scream of Death EP, Whisper of the Evil  
  
[**Breeze Least**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jQunZpxmOg)  
Another personal favorite, Breeze Least were quite Swedish sounding at times, with some neoclassical influence at other times. More than a few superb riffs to be found on the one 80's full length they released. Features some excellent guitar work as well. All round gem, and one of the best in the scene.  
Recommended listening: s/t  
  
[**Fast Draw**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ59J-Io9wo)  
Epic Heavy Metal act drawing influence from such bands as Legend and Manilla Road. The demos are fantastic. The full lengths aren't as good but all of them are at least solid. Good for satisfying that Epic HM itch.
Recommended listening: Damia, Ê†πËÖêÂä£Â±ë („Ç≥„É≥„Éó„É¨„ÉÉ„ÇØ„Çπ)

[**Mein Kampf**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0GFxiLPe_Y)  
A band with an interesting name, Mein Kampf are one of those bands that releases one demo and one EP and then disappears,only to be found years later and achieving cult status. The fantastic EP in question has only two songs, and they're both as phenomenal as Speed Metal can get. Pretty much the Japanese Agent Steel, these guys.  
Recommended listening: Speeder EP  
  
[**Zadkiel**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaP5E28R1_I)  
One of the many, many bands that Venom inspired in the 80's. They only managed a single and an EP. The EP is pretty good, with all the signature Venom elements in place. 
Recommended listening: Hell's Bomber EP  
  
[**Prowler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRjG0Oaamow)  
Playing vicious, raw Speed Metal, Prowler released one stellar EP and one split with Yoke of Steel. Anyway, the one EP they released is worth a listen or 100.  
Recommended listening: Back Fire EP

418,"I thoroughly enjoy these guides and think its a great way for people to get into a band. Seeing as how Mastodon is my favorite band, I decided to do a guide to Mastodon! 

**Remission** - This is a very out of control riff-house type album. The vocals are all not necessarily screamed, but, they are in between yelling and death metal vocals. As for the music, it's tons of crunchy riffs with some bad ass jazz-like drumming in the background. Very raw, spastic, and over all just kick ass metal. The album is loosely based on the theme of fire. Some of of the must listen tracks are [March of the Fire Ants](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MarWv25GOyw) and [Mother Puncher](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muFtXyTZKKY)

**Leviathan** - This album's most notable change is the fact that the vocals sounds more like rough, angry grunts than the yelling/screaming vocals in Remission. Musically, the album took a different direction. The album is a bit more melodic and the song structure is overall more thought out. This album is also a concept album, based around the book ""Moby Dick"" and also the theme of water in general. The crunchy sounding riffs are still there and its still fucking bad ass. As for what songs are must listens, [Blood and Thunder](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-Su1YXQYek) and [Iron Tusk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzVcC0TAN8k) would serve you right.

**Blood Mountain** - This is when everything gets more proggy. This album is, again, a concept album that tells the story of a man who is trying to climb Blood Mountain to place the crystal skull at the top. It's about his whole journey up there with the different things he encounters. This album sounds different than the previous albums in a sense that it's just angry, riffy metal. It's sort of toned down a bit in terms of riffage, but, its not a bad thing. It sounds a bit more patient and smoother, if that makes sense. There'll be parts when the music tones down and its clean vocals kick in and it gets less heavy sounding. Speaking of vocals, the vocals are half clean and half yelled/grunted/whatever. Must listens are [The Wolf is Loose](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm9P1QsoGhw) and [Siberian Divide](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2IGkpkagz8)

**Crack The Skye** - This is when things get REALLY proggy. The album is another concept album story. This time, the story is much more elaborate. In the shortest way I can explain it, it's about this quadriplegic boy who learns how to separate his soul from his body, but, he flies too close to the sun when hes out of his body and it burns his golden umbilical cord that keeps him from drifting off. He begins to drift off into space, but, gets sucked into a wormhole where he explains to the spirits that he's not dead. They send him to Czarist era Russia where cultists are performing a divination. He ends up in the body of Rasputin. He explains to Rasputin his situation, but, then Czarina warns Rasputin that he's going to be assassinated. Instead of avoiding this, Rasputin goes to his assassination destination so that he can guide the boy back to his body. After he dies, they fly between heaven and hell where Satan intercepts them and takes them to hell. They escape and its assumed they either make it to his body or stay in space forever. The album is also generally based around the element of Ether. Sorry, I had to explain that whole thing. This album is much less heavy than their previous work. It has a bit of a softer, creepy class rock feel to it in a way, but, it's still metal. There's many more guitar solos, practically in every song. The music is also slower paced and uses powerful clean vocals with perfectly executed guitar parts instead of thrashing riffs and harsh vocals. It's not something you headbang the whole way through, but, you have to sit down and listen to it carefully to enjoy it. This is also my favorite album of all time and what I think is Mastodon's best album. Must listens are [Oblivion](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzQ5o7b7qf0) and [The Czar](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jx2fp-kKOIw)

**The Hunter** - The Hunter is kind of the result of them getting tired of making these elaborate concept albums, so, they decided to take a break and just make a good metal album. Stylistically, its heavier than Crack The Skye, but, not as heavy as their other albums, but, it still maintains their sound. It's got some sweet riffs and some good vocal pieces. It's a perfectly put together album for what it is, if that makes sense. Must listens are [Curl of the Burl](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAihDAJX8Ow) and [Stargasm](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fte2YrMta7g)

**Call of The Mastodon** - This is just a remastered compilation of their demo with one new song, which is simply called ""Call of The Mastodon"". The vocals on the album are similar to Remission, in a sense that theyre using the death metal yelling hybrid vocals. The vocals almost sound like battle chants, delivery is definitely a lil different. There's definitely some grind influence in here. Musically, its just a lot of bad ass riffs, not too melodic, just plundering, pillaging riffs to headbang to. It seems like they wanted to pump out a bunch of angry, bursty, spastic metal songs, which they did. Fantastic songs. Must listens are [Shadows That Move]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o93ttGgeUX4) and [Hail To Fire]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIwFfdUD2TE)

If you're interested in Mastodon, hopefully I did a good job with this. Please tell me how I did. Thanks for reading, it was fun to make!

Edit: I added Call of The Mastodon, as requested."

Now, upon analyzing what the best heavy record of the year is, by calculating 75 album-of-the-year-lists from international critics for [To The Teeth](https://www.facebook.com/metaltotheteeth/posts/1764913083803988), our holy book casts the inflexible frown of disappointment: the number one is not in the Big Book of Metal. **Converge**, set to lead this list from very early on with their november release ‚ÄòThe Dusk in Us‚Äô, is a metalcore band. *The* metalcore band, arguably. If they can top a metal end of the year list - *the* metal end of the year list - what does that tell us? Well first of all that metal isn‚Äôt so genrefocused anyway, and that Converge is really really popular in all of the heavy music world. They were on a third of all calculated lists, only rivaled by the number 2, **Power Trip** with their ‚ÄòNightmare Logic‚Äô. Converge landed four number 1 spots, also rivaled by Power Trip - who even had more number 2 spots (five, over four for Converge). But overall the Massachusetts metalcore band surmounted the Dallas thrash metal/crossover band (which they are according to MA) with ten points - not a larg margin, but a fair win by all means. Number 3, **Pallbearer**‚Äôs ‚ÄòHeartless‚Äô, didn‚Äôt come close to with 97 points, followed by **Bell Witch** with 88 points, who neatly defeated the big guns of **Mastodon** (number 5 with 83 points). They ended up only just above **Pyrrhon**, who gathered 80 points and stayed ahead of well established acts like **Elder**, **Paradise Lost**, **Chelsea Wolfe** and - sorry MA, this is not the Bavarian heavy metal/hardrock band - **Code Orange**, who close out the top ten.

##In Listing Spirit
This year‚Äôs List of Lists included 75 eoty-lists, which resulted in 529 records in total. I included as much great general lists I could find, and I tried to have a good mainstream/underground mix. Every number 1 got 10 points, the numbers 2 got 9 points, and so on. Every number 10 and lower got 1 point. I chose staff lists from certain outlets, and did every single one from others. Some have had more power than others that way (**L√∂r** wouldn‚Äôt be on the list at all if it wasn‚Äôt for the Angry Metal Guy lists), but I‚Äôve tried to weigh this as properly as I could. I filtered out most non-heavy releases, but I (obviously) didn‚Äôt comb out all metalcore or other punk/hardcore derived records. These lists aren‚Äôt rigid genre confined lists, after all, but lists with the best heavy records of the year. I did sift out all records that got only one mention, even if it got 10 points. This is to prevent too much power to just one critic or magazine. The final list is 228 records long, from **Converge** all the way down to **Suffering Hour**. Those that are available on Spotify, [are in one big playlist: 1871 songs, almost 160 hours](https://open.spotify.com/user/pvdp/playlist/4wkQowzgDyybTGxuHuELHh) of the best heavy music. From **Bell Witch**‚Äôs massive Mirror Reaper (83 minutes) to **Wvrm**‚Äôs tiny ‚ÄòDistinguish‚Äô (17 unrelenting seconds). You can also still listen to my weekly updated [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/pvdp/playlist/7s2xt5dCX0e5S4Om9vyHKg) with new metal, which I'll be cleaning out for 2018's releases. My personal favorite records of the year are [in this playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/pvdp/playlist/7g5ojTHV5XmN2F7Mh3rIU7).


There will be records you hate that are very high on this list. Others are far too low or miss all together. Don‚Äôt be mad. There‚Äôs nothing I can do about it. If you miss something and can‚Äôt believe it wasn‚Äôt scored high enough to make the top-50, just ask me and I‚Äôll see if I can find where it ended on the longlist. It‚Äôs hard not to find something you like though. There‚Äôs thrash, heavy, epic, doom, grind, crust, black, death and powerviolence on the complete list. Blackgaze, industrial, n√º, viking, drone, funeral, speed, stoner, symphonic, sludge, pagan, post, pirate, power, prog and (I‚Äôm bluffing here) pornogrind.

There was a group of people all rejected for the same reason so i stood around with them talking when suddenly Travis Ryan comes out of the building and asks us whats going on. We explain the situation and he gets visibly pissed. He says hes going to talk the owner and he goes back inside hopefully to unleash fury upon this guy. When he comes back he looks even more pissed and says he tried to get us in but there was nothing he could do. To make up for it he sold all us underagers merch directly out of the van and took pictures with us. Good to know that he fought for our right to stay brutal \m/ and i now kno firsthand that he is one of the nicest dudes.

481,If you like listening to Kill ‚ÄòEm All...
482,"For a second there, I thought Skeletonwitch got a new vocalist to match their name.  (I already feel bad about this)"
483,"The vibe I get from this place is that, if mayonesa, ma1kel, or asphyx667 don't like your taste in metal, it's ""hipster metal"".  Cases in point: Mastodon, Baroness, Boris, The Sword, etc.  They'll go on tirades abut how ""hipsters"" are ruining metal, and this ""shitty hipster metal"" is killing our community.

No, assholes, *you're* ruining our community.  If you like Mastodon, listen to them.  If you don't, *don't comment* and *don't downvote*.  I don't want this turning into r/circlejerk, but enough is enough.  All you seem to do, and I'm gonna catch hell for this, is act like the hipsters you so despise.

This ""My metal is more valid than [X]'s metal because [blah blah blah]"" attitude you two (and others) perpetuate is what's fucking killing Shreddit, and metal in general.  So what if a band has achieved mainstream success?  So what if you don't like their music?  I don't fucking like Black Metal, but you don't see me commenting on every Black Metal link posted with ""hey look, another song with terrible production.  I guess ProTools is too popular for these hipsters, huh?  I guess they just want their LPs to sound like demos.""

Get the fuck off your high horses people; our diverse tastes in music are what makes metal great.  Without that, we don't have the speed that punk brought us, the live shows inspired by arena rock, the solos inspired by blues and classical music, or the epic vocals drawn straight from opera and classical performance.  Act like you've got some common fucking decency about yourselves, and start respecting that there are people out there who will like bands that you do not.  Just hide their submissions and move along.

Ban me if you want, but for fuck's sake this needs to be said.  You act like ""hipsters"" are ruining metal; no, elitist metalheads like you are, because all you do is pick out bands that you don't like and bash them for not being exactly what you want to hear.  You know, [the same thing that critics did to the original Black Sabbath LP when it first hit shelves](http://bit.ly/dmfk6j).

EDIT: Alright, seems like a lot of Shreddit is weighing in here.  Good.

Oh yeah, and mayonesa- as far as me shitting on other people, thinking my opinion should be law, etc.- I'm not the one calling for the death of whatever metal I don't like.  It's my opinion that this board should at least be civil and respectful, and if that's not your opinion, then I'm not altogether sure you belong here.  If you think that this subreddit should be a place for you to spout off about how much you hate [X]'s musical taste, perhaps we need a r/metalcirclejerk for you and the rest of the ""old school"" guys on here.

My opinion differs from your because where mine fosters intelligent discussion and thoughtful commentary, yours just plays the ""hipster trash, kill it because I don't like it"" card over and over and over and over and over and over and over..."

506,"Four of these bands I'm already a huge fan of (With Slayer being my favourite metal band) and I've heard that Gojira is amazing live so I'm also looking forward to that. 

This will probably be the biggest concert I've ever gone too and I'm so incredibly excited! Here in Norway metal concerts of this scale are few and far between each other, but this year we've scheduled quite a few big metal acts which I won't be missing out on. I'm also going to Slottsfjell festival later this year (where Opeth and Carcass among others are playing) and [Tons of Rock](http://tonsofrock.no/program/), which is jammed packed with great metal bands.

I'm relatively new to metal concerts, so if you have some tips to share let me know! Also if you've seen any of these bands live before: How was it? Good? Bad? Would love to hear some inputs on what to expect!"

510,"Hi,
Any drummers and guitar players from Europe, please keep your eyes open when lurking on eBay or any other place.


My rehearsal space were robbed in night between 17.10.2016 and 18.10.2016. Stolen items are Engl amps and cabinet, Ampeg amp and cabinet also my Mapex Black Panther Blaster with Sledgehammer snare. Also Tama Speed Cobra double pedals and hi-hat stand. Also lots of Sabian AAX/HHX cymbals not to mention cymbal stands and other hardware. Total cost 8200EUR/9000USD which is a astronomical amount of money considering that Polish Zloty (PLN) is like 1USD = over 4 PLN.


We got one witness, a guy who was working at night in his workhouse. He said that he heard bunch of people that were carrying something to bus/van. He is convicted that hey were speaking Ukrainian/Russian. Nowadays there is shitload of Ukrainian/Russian people in Poland, especially in my area - Wroc≈Çaw.


It is possible that all items are in Germany/Czech/Ukraine/Belarus right now. Please let me know if you see of missing gears in portal auctions in your country. I'll be thankful for links to auction portals/eBay clones in Germany, Czech Republic, Ukraine and other western countries.


It took me 6 years to complete my gears, mostly from second-hand. It's waaay too much for simple Slav like me, since in Poland prices are like in any other EU country but salaries are like 1/5 of EU. No kidding.

Having never been to a metal concert before, i almost shat my pants and managed to get a cousin to get me tickets. 

Fast forward a month and i'm in London at the O2 arena and find out i don't have seats, i'm actually standing and cannot believe my luck. Now i'm really fucking pumped up and end up only 10 feet from the stage thanks to coming extra early. After an awesome band named Voodoosix finishes a couple of songs, it starts. First song? The Moonchild. And thus begins one of the best nights of my life. Now i'm not that strong, i'm a 17 year old with little body mass but i forget everything and start battling for the front row with fellow metalheads and at this point it seemed to me that the entire concert was a moshpit. I was drenched in sweat and beer while standing mere feet away from the gods of metal. The choruses we sang together and the sheer beauty of standing arm in arm with strangers was something i will never forget. I cherished every single bloody moment of it. Metalheads are the most passionate and brilliant people i know and i could see that passion in everyone's eyes that night. Thank you for being such an awesome community and here's to hoping we'll see each other in a moshpit someday. \m/

Hello /r/metal! Perhaps you're familiar with modern bands like [Eternal Champion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZRi_9HwMbE) and [Visigoth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqc1yNuFrps) and want more modern bands in that vein. Maybe you've always been a fan of legends like [Queensryche](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_WUaMci6qo), [Metal Church](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXrAU072rDE), and [Manowar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFgMgu2nwYc) but you never realized that they played in this type of style and that there's a whole lot more out there. 

If you are anything like I used to be, then there's a good chance you might be operating under the assumption that all power metal is like the European strain that bands like [Rhapsody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYzYo-XJfUI) play. That's not really the case! There's a plethora of power metal that's much more rooted in the traditional metal sound that you're more familiar with.

Hopefully with this guide I can help guide you in the right direction when it comes to United States power metal (USPM)!

###**Context**

The aim here is to provide a stronger, better written resource than my outdated 4 year old primers to help introduce people to the basics and essentials of USPM. This guide is meant to be simple to follow and straight to the point. A big thank you to /u/highwaycorsair, /u/deathofthesun, /u/crucervix, /u/kaelrok, and everyone else who helped me focus my thoughts as well as provide suggestions along the way. You guys are awesome!

Original version of this primer is up on my site: www.RideIntoGlory.com
________________________________________________________

###**What is USPM and what does it sound like?**

USPM stands for United States Power Metal ‚Äì an evolution of traditional metal that took place in the US starting around the early-mid 80‚Äôs. Most people are familiar with the European Style of power metal ‚Äì USPM is different in sound to that. To lift from my first primer, USPM has a very distinct  grit to it. The very core of USPM is influenced by the early NWOBHM movement. The pioneers of the USPM movement took the NWOBHM and made it into something entirely their own. They sped it up. They made it more energetic. They increased the number of solos. The vocals were intensified. They added POWER.

There were two distinct styles that emerged within USPM ‚Äì I'll refer to them as ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù and ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù. You may have seen me use the terms ""blue collar"" or ""white collar"" before but no one really uses those terms outside of myself and a few dorks over at metal-archives. It's a silly classist terminology that I didn't even make up myself. I'll be moving away from using those terms moving forward. ""Aggressive USPM"" is more speed metal oriented in nature, often times flirting with thrash as well. ""Progressive USPM"" has a focus on melodies and bigger vocals while usually incorporating more complex song structures. These distinctions aren‚Äôt hard and fast (many bands blur the line in between), but rather they should serve as general guidelines.

The following releases in my humble opinion serve as fantastic gateways to exploring the genre. They consist of some of the best releases in USPM and act as wonderful representatives of the various sounds found in the genre.

###Special Mentions:##

[Special Mentions Infographic](https://imgur.com/a/olvqFXT)

There were a few bands that released material similar to USPM but don't *quite* fit the moniker. These bands are undoubtedly high quality and at times certainly flirted with the USPM sound (some a lot more than others). Both the quality and influence of this bands cannot be understated and for those reasons I believe they deserve a special mention here.

###Modern Heroes: 90s-Current Day USPM

[90s-Current Day USPM Infographic](https://imgur.com/a/1WVcGRn)

###**Editor's Choice - Full Length Albums**

In this section I'll describe the releases I personally feel are the absolutely most distinguished. I'll break it out by full length and EPs. For this section, I'll refrain from repeating bands since the list is short and I'll omit bands from the ""special mentions"" section above - otherwise I'll essentially be left with a list full of Manilla Road and Cirith Ungol.

Remember, this is just my personal opinion so feel free to totally disagree!

**Full Lengths:**

5) Cauldron Born - [Born of the Cauldron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J23Yk24gWiw)

A true masterpiece of 90s metal that is equal parts Fates Warning and Helstar. It's a mix of both the progressive and aggressive elements of USPM brought together in a perfect harmony by Howie Bentley's twisted mind. Complex riffs, epic song structures, and catchy vocal melodies - it's all there. The end result is a highly unique and top-notch album that you just have to experience for yourself.

4) Fates Warning - [Awaken the Guardian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkvqrCGuS10)

Fates Warning, the popularizers of progressive/power metal, delivered a ridiculous 1-2 punch in the mid 80s having released Spectre Within in 1985 and then Awaken the Guardian in 1986. *Legions* of bands have since tried to imitate what they've done on those two records to varying degrees of success. Both Spectre and Awaken the Guardian are landmark USPM albums but I believe Awaken personally takes the cake.  This album has the same masterful song structures and riffing as Spectre but is overall more accessible. John Arch's vocals are definitely unique and take some getting used to for folks, but once you get past that the band's musical prowess really shines through.

Absolutely essential listening.

3) Crimson Glory - [Crimson Glory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVFLFQ1b95A)

Classy, powerful, and majestic, Crimson glory's self titled debut delivers everything I could possibly ask for in a USPM release. The songwriting is simple but the riffs are extremely memorable. The album is carried by Midnight's transcendent vocals - there are plenty of moments where I just think to myself ""How is he even able to fucking do that?"". Overall, the Crimson Glory ST is an astounding album with a remarkable almost intangible quality to it that has me constantly replaying it throughout the years.

2) Jag Panzer - [Ample Destruction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruxGZAgM0Rk)

Aggressive, ballsy, and uncompromising. If Crimson Glory's debut is everything I look for in a progressive USPM album, then Jag Panzer is everything I look for in the aggressive variety. This album has always been my go to recommendation for first time listeners to USPM. The aggressive and uncompromising nature of Henry ""The Tyrant"" Conklin and co. grab you by the throat and never let go. Ample Destruction is the hallmark USPM album and demonstrates the stark contrast found between USPM and their European cousins.

1) Tyrant - [Too Late to Pray](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0ssI-CbDic)

Paragon - ""a person or thing regarded as a perfect example of a particular quality"". 

This is my personal metal paragon. Not just USPM - this album possesses all the qualities I could possibly ask for in a release. Powerful mid-paced riffing that balances aggression, doom, and epicness topped off with testosterone filled vocals. The production is unique and *heavy* and when combined with the music creates an atmosphere of Armageddon unlike anything else out there. I've spent the last 10 years since I found this album looking for anything remotely similar to no avail. I could spend hours talking about how this album has changed how I view metal and music as a whole, but that wouldn't do it justice. 

Too Late to Pray is a unique album that really just needs to be experienced. If there's anything you take from my primers, just listen to this album at least once.

###**Editor's Choice - EPs**


5) Medieval Steel - [Medieval Steel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0q9Vzjefnik)

MEDIEVAL STEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEL! IT CUTS YOU LIKE A KNIFE!!

Medieval steel play a slow to mid paced brand of USPM that is focused very heavily on the vocals. The result is a grand, epic sound that is reminiscent of Manowar's slower, more grandiose moments found on releases like Into Glory Ride. This band's self titled EP, and song more specifically, have become cult classics for their anthem-worthy pace and choruses. Essential listening if only for the title track. 

4) Dark Age - [Dark Age](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSPI6cGn3dA)

Dark Age's self titled EP is one of the first releases I discovered and found myself really getting into after scratching the surface USPM. There's a magical uplifting energy coming from the vocals and riffs that make it very clear this band was having an absolute blast putting together this release. Every song is unique and has its own little character and story around it from the faster paced bangers such as ""Metal Axe"" and ""Warrior"" to the slow and epic ""Tales of Medusa"". This EP has gained a status of reverence and worship in trad circles for its superior quality. The music here is so good that legendary cult band Tales of Medusa named themselves after one of the songs here - in fact, I'd be willing to say that their sound is *extremely* influenced by the style and structure of this song in particular.

This little EP has become one of my most listened to USPM releases since discovering the genre. It is really a shame that we didn't any more material out of this band.

3) Savatage - [The Dungeons are Calling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6u5ZexCYY_Y)

Savatage's Dungeons are Calling EP came right after the band's remarkable debut Sirens. Stylistically, it serves as an effective continuation of Sirens but with a slightly more aggressive edge. Every song on this EP is 100% killer and 0% filler. After listening to this album, you too will feel captured by the grace of the witch because I sure as hell am with every listen.

2) Queensryche - [Queensryche](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_WUaMci6qo)

Queensryche - the legendary power progressive band - started out far simpler than whatever they became later in their career. Their self titled EP was their first major release and it provides us with a very straight forward 17 minute slab of metal. Queenryche's relatively simple approach on this EP doesn't take anything away from the music at all, in fact it does the exact opposite. The 1983 release of this EP set the foundation for what the progressive side of USPM would start to sound like. Queen of the Reich and The Lady Wore Black, both found here on this EP, became some of the most recognizable songs out of the USPM movement. The legendary Queensryche at their best.

1) Warlord - [Deliver Us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFg478hQyOk)

Warlord's first major release is incredibly varied and complex from the dark and slower ""Black Mass"" to the more aggressive and in your face ""Child of the Damned"". The vocals, riffing, song structures - everything is tight on this EP. Each song on here is a classic, it's truly astounding.

Last night my local metal band was scheduled to open for Iced Earth in St. Petersburg Florida. We had been booked for the event three months in advanced. After spending a month and a half preparing, promoting, and even working in a pair of replacement musicians, we show up to the venue to be told some ""bad news"". 

""Sorry guys, but Iced Earth's bus broke down on their way to the venue and now we're running behind schedule. My boss has told me to cut the local."" 

So, the Headlining act is running behind on their line-check which means... screw the local! That's right we can no longer afford to let you guys play your 20 minute set. A whopping 20 minutes.. 18 in our case as we were only playing THREE SONGS. Then come to find out one of the four touring bands didn't even show. Yet our 20 minutes would apparently jeopardize the enactment of the show.

Now my intent is not to attack the touring bands, or the management for that matter. I'm more upset with what has become of the music industry. We were NOT putting our time into this show to make money. Our goal was to gain some local exposure... and what better way to be heard than playing national shows. Had we been handed 30 pre-sale tickets to sell would we have been cut? The fact of the matter is, regardless of the quality of music, if no one is making any money off of you... you're not important."

Their Terminal Redux is the best album of 2016 according to a calculated List of Lists, made out of no less than 83 heavy end of the year lists I crunched down for [To The Teeth](https://www.facebook.com/metaltotheteeth/posts/1629762337319064).
 

Every list's number one got 10 points, the number two got 9, and so on. The now troubled Vektor easily plucked the number one slot of this list, with 165 points. Runner-up **Khemmis**' Hunted got 136 points and the bronze medal was snatched by **Blood Incantation**'s Starspawn with 111 points. But Vektor isn't completely undisputed. From all those lists, they got six number 1 positions on the 28 lists they were mentioned on. That‚Äôs not particularly many, considering the size of the sample. Khemmis got three number 1 positions. Blood Incantation has four silvers and five bronzes, but never got a gold medal on any list.

#Variations on banality
Of course, these are just lists. Just people who have written down what they liked this year. Sometimes in a group, sometimes within a certain subgenre, and yes, sometimes with their readership, medium or relations with bands and labels in mind. That's allright. Music in general is not a competition and it‚Äôs had to draw any conclusions about the state of music after some calculations. But still. Does the list tell us anything? Maybe we lost the big gods, like most genres. We're fragmented, divided. Sure. But we also have a lot to choose from. Metal is super diverse. The menu in front of us maybe lacks some signature dishes, but there sure is something for everyone. It‚Äôs not only metal either. I did this kind of list for my day job on pop music, and the obvious number one, Bowie‚Äôs Blackstar, wasn‚Äôt on top of a waving flag on a shiny silver tower above the rest - not like Kendrick Lamar was last year anyway. Some records I thought would do quite well, like Borknagar, Fuath and Negura Bunget, weren‚Äôt mentioned in the first 400 I wrote down. Big names like Darkthrone, Ulcerate and Uada weren‚Äôt even among the first 100 albums mentioned - although all three made the top-50. But some popular bands didn‚Äôt even make the cut at all: Destr√∂yer 666, Brujeria, Ultha, Grand Magus, Vader‚Ä¶ They were mentioned, but only once. Then again, others did much better than I‚Äôd expect. Astronoid is on 11, Mithras on 12, Haken, Hammers of Misfortune and Ghoul are all quite high. Did you expect that? I don't think I did. I was just really surprised how varied people‚Äôs lists were in the end. Almost every list added another one or two, and often more new records to the list.


This year‚Äôs list included 83 numerical eoty-lists which added up to 558 records in total. It was a lot of work to crunch down, and I probably made some mistakes. You can also easily criticize my methods, but I included as much great general lists I could find and tried to have a good mainstream/credible/underground mix and I think the list reflects that. Beforehand I filtered out most non-metal releases, but I didn‚Äôt comb out all the hardcore and hardcore-derived records that will never be one of us. They were on a lot of metal-lists, anyway. I did delete every record that had just one mention. Even if it was a number one record on a list. This to prevent too much power in the hands of just one critic or magazine. Everybody I included still has had some punch to throw, tough. I mean, see this as a huuuuge salad. You add all ingredients. Olives, tomatoes, maybe you like feta in it, maybe some rucola? Some asshole has thrown in a couple of madame jeanette peppers. Just a couple, but everybody's going to taste them. The final list is now 230 records long. I‚Äôve put everything that was available **[in this Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/pvdp/playlist/3b81m0AbxGE8WKhiEyciK6)**.

#Hatework
There will be records you hate that are too high in this list. Others are too low or miss all together. Don‚Äôt be mad, don't downvote. There‚Äôs nothing I can do about it. And we‚Äôre all metalheads, and if there‚Äôs something we do well, it‚Äôs discuss metal right? Don't let thousands of eyebrows be raised in silence. If you miss something and can‚Äôt believe it wasn‚Äôt scored high enough to make the top-50, just ask me and I‚Äôll see if I can find where it ended on the longlist. It‚Äôs hard not to find something you like though. There‚Äôs thrash, heavy, epic, doom, grind, crust, black, death and powerviolence on the complete list. Blackgaze, industrial, n√º, viking, unblack, drone, funeral, Speed, stoner, symphonic, sludge, pagan, post, pirate, power, prog and pornogrind. Last note: it's a pity I couldn't include Shreddit's top of 2016 list, and although I don't agree, I understand why /u/Kaptain_Carbon wants to see the year end first. No worries though: I think this list can serve as a reminder of what came out this year as inspiration for your lists here on Shreddit.

563,LIST OF LISTS: Vektor made the best record of 2016 (according to 83 end-of-year lists)
564,"Frank Watkins (February 19, 1968  ‚Äì October 18, 2015) was an American heavy metal musician best known as a former, long-time bass player for the death metal band Obituary. Since late 2007 he has been the bass player of the Norwegian black metal band Gorgoroth. After years of battling cancer, Obituary announced his death over their social media pages today.

Post from Obituary's Facebook Page: https://www.facebook.com/ObituaryBand/photos/a.10151652926685957.1073741828.327554930956/10153046354825957/?type=3

Frank Watkins began playing music at the age of 12, and began his professional career in 1986, before joining with Obituary in 1989. He has played on every Obituary release, except for their debut album Slowly We Rot and cites his musical influences as ""anything dark, aggressive, and pissed off"" and tends to bring his punk/hardcore background to the realm of death/black metal. Frank prided himself not only on the technical side of his music, but also in the business aspect, managing, mentoring, and guiding other bands and musicians. He formed his management company Back From the Dead Productions in 2007 in hopes to help bands create a positive career in the music business. In late 2007 Watkins became the bassist of Norwegian black metal band Gorgoroth, and in 2009 he participated in the recording of the Gorgoroth album Quantos Possunt ad Satanitatem Trahunt. He debuted live with the band at the Hole in the Sky festival in Bergen on August 29, 2009. This was the first concert Gorgoroth had performed since September 2007. In an interview with Metal Maniacs published online in August 2009, Watkins explained that for his work with Gorgoroth he had taken the stage name ""B√∏ddel"", which means ""Executioner"" in Norwegian.

571,"Greetings. 

As our subreddit grows, we would like to be relevant and ever changing with our moderation. The blacklist has not been updated for quite sometime. In fact, it has been 2 years since it first created without amendments. We are always open to the idea of adding and subtracting bands to make sure this subreddit stays fluid with different content. today we welcome Blind Guardian, Agalloch, and Behemoth to the halls of the popular metal alumni. Old material from these bands are no longer allowed on this subreddit. Now I know what you are thinking. 

**Why don't you just let the users decide content, that is what upvote and downvote is for right?**

Similar to our rule on images, recognizable bands and particularly popular albums get upvoted without being listened to as oppose to new content which takes longer to process. You already like ""Run to the Hills"" or ""Ace of Spades"" so you upvote it. This means recognizable things rise to the top and anything new gets ignored. If a top post consists of a majority of people complaining about reposts, then something is wrong. If two or three songs from a band gets reposted constantly, then something needs to be changed. This is the same problem that a lot of large subs fight against with a constant changing user base. The reason images are banned is not becasue the mods hate picture rather an image of a grandmother giving the metal horns takes less time to process than a four paragraph review of a new album. We would like to make this place interesting not just for new people but also for our community who frequents everyday. 

**You are just picking bands you don't like right? Soon this whole sub will be black and death metal recorded in a potato cave.**

While is certainly seems that we are picking on newer bands, any band that has an equal share of reposts and complaints against the reposts are subject to scrutiny. If Traitor's Gate suddenly became number 1 for a few times each month with the majority of comments decrying its place in this sub, we would look into it. Also it would be hard to argue an elitist tyranny when bands like Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, and Iron Maiden are the first on the list. 

**New stuff and news is still alright though?**

Absolutely.

**What about old songs with new videos like my favorite song overtop of Lord of the Rings footage or the blizzard that is coming?**

That would be better suited for another sub. 

**But what if a new metalhead never gets to hear these three bands because you just outlawed them?**

While I am certain this will never happen, every stray recommendation thread (which is rarely seen by the larger public) gets a paragraph of information with the first step pointing to the blacklist bands. These bands have become staples in a majority of journeys through the dark lands of heavy metal. I am sure people will stumble on them eventually.

**Fuck you, I am unsubbing, this place has gone downhill.**

We wish you the best of luck in your endeavors.

**Seriously, I am fucking out, no more contributions from me. I hope everyone leaves this place, fascist.** 

The bus stop is just around the corner.

**This is the last sentence I am ever typing in this place**

Got it. 

 

*If your query has not been answered by a condescending strawman, please feel free to ask here and we will be glad to answer your question in a calm collected manner. Thank you for making shreddit the best place in the underworld.*

579,"Precisely what the title says. Post all of the really awesome free (and legal) metal that you know of. For the benefit of broke students/invalids everywhere!
In case it wasn't obvious, no illegal downloads allowed.

Labels:

[Fallen Empire Records](http://bandcamp.fallenempirerecords.com/): Literally one of the best black metal labels out there right now, and all of their stuff is free! They have a couple of really fantastic records coming out on February 17th, so watch out!

[Replenish Records](http://replenishrecords.bandcamp.com/): A fantastic label which caters mainly to the modern/post styles of black metal. Most of their stuff is free, including Alda, Falls Of Rauros and Vestiges, so get in there!

[Gilead Media](http://gileadmedia.bandcamp.com/): A label which focuses on the forward-thinking styles of extreme metal. It's no suprise many of Colin Marston's projects are here. Also, False.

[Blood Music](http://blood-music.bandcamp.com/): A killer label which does a whole bunch of great vinyl releases, as well as puts out a bunch of AAA metal records out for free on this bandcamp store.

[Throatruiner Records](http://store.throatruinerrecords.com/freedownloads): French label that specializes exclusively in blackened hardcore. So many good releases, it's hard to choose anything to talk about. All of the releases are free, too!

[Hypnotic Dirge Records](http://hypnoticdirgerecords.bandcamp.com/): A great label specializing in the blackgaze/post-black metal genres. They've got a great catalog with a whole bunch of interesting bands, so check them out!

[Markov Soroka](http://markovsoroka.bandcamp.com/): Not so much  a label, but rather the extensive catalog of one brilliant man by the name of, you guessed it! Markov Soroka. He's the man behind killer acts like Aureole and Eternium, so get over there quick-like!

Artists:

[Sithu Aye](http://sithuayemusic.bandcamp.com/): Really great guitar-centric post metal/prog. 

[Cloudkicker](http://cloudkickermusic.com/): These guys are really well known around here, but if you don't know the name, check them the fuck out. Atmospheric prog/post metal/rock stuff.

[Abyssal](http://abyssal-home.bandcamp.com/): Dark and heavy. This takes all the nastiest and heaviest elements from doom, death and black metal and forges them into one of the most interesting and unsettling projects I've heard.

[Scimitar](http://scimitar.bandcamp.com/album/black-waters): Obligatory for me to post these guys. They're a band local to me who play some epic folky melodic death metal. If you ever have the opportunity to see them live, DO IT.

[Demilich](http://www.anentity.com/demilich/download.php): The precursor of all the skronky death metal we take for granted these days. Weird as fuck and absolutely killer.

[Delete The Mass](http://deletethemass.bandcamp.com/album/-): Crazy Greek grindcore with the best vocals I've heard in the genre so far. I've been playing this record nonstop since I got it a couple years ago, and I recommend you do too!

[Akelei](http://akelei.bandcamp.com/album/de-zwaarte-van-het-doorstane): Great German doom with one of the best productions I've heard. Oddly enough, I think they have the best crash cymbal sound in metal.

[Cormorant](http://cormorant.bandcamp.com/): Based folk melodic death/black metal.Unfortunately, their new album isn't free.

[M√ñRKHIMMEL](http://morkhimmel666.bandcamp.com/album/ost-ern-kosy-zn): Czech Entombed worship. They've got a great HM-2 tone going, along with some ferocious vocals.

[Deathrite](http://deathrite.bandcamp.com/album/into-extinction-2): HM-2 worshipping old school death metal with a lot of grindcore influence.

[Black Monolith](http://blackmonolith.bandcamp.com/): Crusty black metal hardcore stuff. Fuckin' A!

[Encircling Sea](http://encirclingsea.bandcamp.com/releases): Kickass Cascadian black metal.

[Jute Gyte](https://jutegyte.bandcamp.com/): Weird dissonant black metal. The highlights are the excellent use of microtonal guitars and the vicious vocals.

[Gatecreeper](https://gatecreeper.bandcamp.com/album/gatecreeper): Old school death metal revival band. Standard HM-2 wosrship stuff, but the fucking riffs, man! The RIFFS!

[Slugdge](https://slugdge.bandcamp.com/album/gastronomicon): Genre-bending extreme metal about slugs. It's exactly as great as you think it is.

[Sun Worship](https://sunworship.bandcamp.com/album/elder-giants): Atmospheric black metal from Germany with lots of influence from the Cascadian scene.

[Thou](https://thou.bandcamp.com/album/heathen): One of the best sludge bands out today. The riffs are simply sublime with this band.

[Old Man Wizard](http://oldmanwizard.com/): Heavy progressive rock/metal. The lyrics and the vocals are absolutely fantastic, as well as the songwriting.

[Titan](http://titanslays.bandcamp.com/): Fast and heavy sludge with lots of hardcore influence. The riffs and energy with this band are second to none.

[Torture Chamber](http://torturechamberofficial.bandcamp.com/): Evil sounding black metal with lots of death metal influence, especially on the production.

[Mitochondrion](http://mitochondrion.ca/):
Another sweet band from my hometown. They play some of the sickest and most evil blackened death metal ever.

[Mare Cognitum](https://marecognitum.bandcamp.com/album/phobos-monolith): Spacey atmospheric black metal by a redditor! Most of his releases are free, but his newest one, Phobos Monolith, isn't. However, if you have some dough, make sure to buy that one, because it's the best one he's put out.

[Mendel](http://mendelian.bandcamp.com/): Some heavy instrumental prog metal by one of the guitarists from Aborted.

[Laster](http://laster.bandcamp.com/album/de-verste-verte-is-hier): Holy mother of atmospheric black metal. I'm not sure why they call it ""Obscure Dance Music"", but it's bloody fantastic!

[Torrefy](https://torrefy.bandcamp.com/): Killer local thrashers who do a great job of implementing a wide swathe of influences into their retro thrash sound. The full album isn't free, but most of the individuals songs can still be donwloaded! However, buy the album if you can. It's absolutely worth it.

[Lake Of Blood](http://lakeovblood.bandcamp.com/album/omnipotens-tyrannus-2): One of the best USBM albums I've ever heard, and it's free! Combine killer songwriting, fantastic atmosphere, brilliant riffs and a devastating bass presence, and you have one hell of a record!

[Lascaille's Shroud](http://lascaillesshroud.bandcamp.com/album/interval-02-parallel-infinities-the-abscinded-universe): Some sweet long-form progressive death metal based off of the  works of one of my favourite science fiction authors, Alastair Reynolds. Everything about this album is big, from the riffs, the sound, and the track lengths.

[Kowloon Walled City](http://kowloonwalledcity.bandcamp.com/album/container-ships): Rocking sludge from San Francisco. They've got one of the best guitar tones in the genre, as well as a great old-school vibe to their songwriting, so give 'em a check!

[In Human Form](http://inhumanformlowell.bandcamp.com/album/earthen-urn-2): Sweet progressive black metal with some interesting uses of electronics and ambience, and a crushing mechanical atmosphere that somehow manages to also sound organic and lively.

[Hollow Truth](http://hollowtruthhc.bandcamp.com/album/the-power-to-endure): Crossover Thrash metal with killer energy and fantastic riffs.

[Mannveira](https://mannveira.bandcamp.com/album/von-er-eitur): Another entry in the expanding Icelandic style of black metal. Featuring a raw-yet-clear atmosphere accompanied by evil and ferocious vocals and guitars, it's hard not to get excited about the future of this band.

[Unsacred Seed](http://unsacredseed.bandcamp.com/album/frontiers): Groovy blackened death metal. Admittedly, I haven't listened to their new album yet, but if it's anything like their debut, it has to be good!

[A Million Dead Birds Laughing](http://amdbl.bandcamp.com/album/xen): Proggy deathgrind featuring members of Ne Obliviscaris. The latest record isn't free, but all the rest are. Highly, HIGHLY recommended.

[Elizabeth](http://ezbth.bandcamp.com/): Sweet blackened hardcore which unfortunately doesn't have anybody named Elizabeth in the band. Regardless, it's really good, so check it the fuck out!

[Evergreen Refuge](http://evergreenrefuge.bandcamp.com/): Instrumental folk/atmospheric black metal. They is absolutely brilliant, not to mention they have one hell of a discography to comb through.

[Walden](http://westshorekult.bandcamp.com/album/metchosin): A local raw/folky atmospheric black metal band(emphasis on raw). They are really good.

[Verlies](http://verlies.bandcamp.com/): Jazzy and progressive post-black metal from France. Fine, fine stuff.

[Skagos](https://skagos.bandcamp.com/album/st): One of the best Cascadian black metal bands operating put of their album 'Ast' for free. The new one, Anarchic, is still a paid purchase, but it is totally worth buying if you have the cash.

[Replacire](http://replacire.bandcamp.com/): Progressive/technical death metal with a great bass presence as well as a keen ear for songwriting. I'm really surprised a big label hasn't snapped them up yet.

[Plebeian Grandstand](http://plebeiangrandstand.bandcamp.com/album/lowgazers): Dark, heavy, sludgy and evil. Just the way I like it. 

[Paramnesia](http://paramnesiaxpa.bandcamp.com/): Atmospheric black metal that sounds similar to Sun Worship. Definitely worth check out.

[Old Iron](http://oldiron.bandcamp.com/album/cordyceps): Riffy sludge with an psychedelic feel. Behold the power of the RIFF!

[Deuil](http://deuil.bandcamp.com/): An interesting mix of sludge and Cascadian black metal which happens to contain some of my favourite drum sounds in metal. The new record is coming out soon, so keep your eyes open!

[Occultist](http://occultist.bandcamp.com/): Nasty, evil, old school thrash/death/black metal. Did I mention 'nasty'?

[Savage Messiah](http://www.earache.com/misc/downloads/savagemessiah/): Thrashy power metal featuring virtuosic guitars and great vocals. Not to mention the riffs are absolutely sublime.

[Evgen_Jr](http://evgenjr.bandcamp.com/): Progressive instrumental death metal from Russia. Even without vocals, they manage to catch and keep your attention, which is a rarity with instrumental extreme metal.

[Entropia](http://entropia.bandcamp.com/): Blackened progressive/post metal. Fantastic songwriting and instrumentation on this record, not to mention the absolutely incredible atmosphere.

[Ellorsith](http://ellorsith.bandcamp.com/releases): Eerie blackened death metal from Russia concerning the Dyatlov Pass incident of 1959. 

[Coilguns](http://coilguns.bandcamp.com/album/commuters): Intense metallic hardcore from Switzerland. Surprisingly, they have no bassist, which is made up for by the titanic guitar rig used here.

[Cara Neir](http://caraneir.bandcamp.com/album/the-overwatch-ep): Blackened Hardcore with a lot of punk focus. You can really pick any record out of their discography and it'll be good.

[Anup Sastry](http://anupsastry.bandcamp.com/): Djenty prog from the drummer of Intervals, Jeff Loomis and Skyharbour. His instrument of choice really shines here.

[Footprints In The Custard](http://footprintsinthecustard.bandcamp.com/): Punkish thrashy metal that never fails to make me laugh. Trust me, read the lyrics.

[Gama Bomb](http://www.earache.com/misc/downloads/gamabomb/): Thrash. Riffs. Cheese. Enough said.

What the hell did a band like Black Sabbath sound like in the early 70's? By today's death metal standards, their music is rather tame (yet still awesome). But having a band like that play music that nobody had ever heard before with obviously an intentional satanic/dark vibe, what did it sound like to you? And what was the reaction of the majority of people to it? Were there a bunch of immediate fans or did it take a while for people to warm up to it?

So, a serious up the irons to you motherfuckers and here's to many more years of kicking it live.

BTW, it was the Loud/Out Fest in Tokyo, and the lineup was Lost Society, Outrage, Anthem, and Loudness.  I went for Outrage, and ended up enjoying everything else more than I thought I would."
638,"Holy shit, the difference proper earplugs make. Thank you, guys."
639,"While it was probably overshadowed by Metalocalype, a series that thrived and revolved around metal, Aqua Teen Hunger Force was arguably the second most metal friendly show on Adult Swim. This month, after 11 Seasons, 138 episodes and a full length film with a theatrical release, it's going to be coming to a close. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the series, or for those who just want to reminisce, let's take a look back at some of the series greatest metal moments. 

**S1 E18 Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the future**: The plot of this episode revolves with Carl's pool full of blood, leading a ghost...who is the ghost of Christmas Past....from the future...who is also a robot, to appear and...kind of explain why this is all happening. 

Long story short, at the end, Danzig makes a cameo and buys Carl's house for 1 Million. 

Clips: 

[Danzig Buys the House](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1EcvliqZQ) 

[Danzig Can't find the robot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu0eu4ziWLo)

**S2 E16 Spirit Journey Formation Anniversary**: This episode is about Shake trying to capitalize on writing a new birthday song and letting the royalties flow in. He does this by recording a new birthday song called ""Spirit Journey Formation Anniversary"" performed by Zakk Wylde (who also plays himself in the episode) and Geddy Lee (voiced by someone other than Geddy Lee). Things start to get worse for Shake when Zakk and Geddy don't get paid.

[Full Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mp2uBZD6y5U)

**S9 E3 Shirt Herpes**: Carl gives shake a shirt from a metal band that transports him to a demon infested world in his dreams. Brent Hinds, Troy Sanders, And Braan Dailor from Mastodon make a cameo as three of the demons. Never by Queenryche is also in this episode as well

Clips: 

[The Legend of Hair Metal Mountain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MxRMwX2SdE)

**Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters** : Adult swim must really love Mastodon. They've released 2 singles with them ([Deathbound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr9_e4ySRYA) and [Atlanta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoK8w6W78DY)), they've used their songs for commercials, been on a tour they put together with Dethklok, Converge and High On fire, and they also did the opening scene for the Aqua Teen Movie. Poking fun at the classic ""[Let's All Go to the Lobby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWFX4ylV_ko)"" movie clip, they started the film with the original song ""Cut You Up With a Linoleum Knife. 

Clip: 

[Cut You Up With a Linoleum Knife](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s13hXBX8w)

**S9 E10 Totem Pole**: Probably my favorite episode in the entire series. It revolves around Carl getting tickets to see his favorite East German metal band ""Totem Pole"" and going to their concert with Shake and Meatwad. Mario Moginger, Mario Liebl, Dominik Kreilinger and Daniel Liebl from Wolfchant guest star as Totem Pole and Lenny, their troll mascot. Wolfchant also wrote a song ""Summon The Troll"" for the episode. I'm hoping that Adult Swim will release the full song, only snippets have been released so far. 

Clips: 

[Totem Pole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnhaRKtE3LY)

So that's it. With Metalocalypse gone Aqua teen was our last really metal friendly show on Adult Swim. What will the future hold? I'm not sure. But at least Adult Swim isn't out of touch with the metal community. With their summer singles program, they've released new songs with Mastodon, [Deafheaven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QenJHuTXcVk), [Pig Destroyer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymJJx9kwd7A), Thou, and the first Song from Sleep in more than a decade. Who knows what's in the future for Adult Swim and metal, but hopefully it will be good.

I'm surprised by the amount of newer albums on his top 10 list.  It seems like when you hear people from his generation talk about this they are always citing the older bands that were their core and have remained their favorites.  

The thought of Halford sitting in his bedroom blasting Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk and deciding this is one of his favorite records of all time is hilarious and awesome.

677,Judas Priest's Rob Halford: 'We're Making Another Record Right Now'
678,"Hi all,

Hopefully this post doesn't violate any rules (if so, my bad!) but I thought I'd share my experience meeting Lemmy. 

Mot√∂rhead is by far my favourite band of all time. I remember buying Overkill on tape when I was about 10, and it blew my fucking mind. 

First time I saw them live, Anthrax and Behemoth were opening (I think) and it was the best show I had seen up to that point. 

Fast forward to 2004, Mot√∂rhead are playing a gig that night in my hometown. (don't remember the opening bands) I showed up well before starting time to catch a glimpse of the band. Luckily, it was a really small venue, and their buses were literally parked across the street. There were a few others waiting too, but most were at a distance. I was standing near the backstage door.

I waited a bit, and then I see Phil come out of a bus and stroll down the street. A little while longer, he appears again, this time holding lots of equipment, heading towards me. There was no one in sight, so I opened and held the door for him. ""Cheers mate!"" he said as he disappeared inside.

A little while longer, Mikkey shows up as well then goes inside. They both looked really busy, so I didn't ask for a chat or autograph.

Now there was only one person left. 

A little while longer, I heard someone call ""Hey Lemmy!"" and there he was, walking directly towards me. 

Now, I have to mention, long before I knew I'd ever get to meet Lemmy, I've always thought that should I ever get the chance to meet him, I would give him something so stupid and ridiculous that I'd make him laugh. Luckily, I found such a stupid thing!

It was ""The 5th Pig"". An image of 4 pigs that when folded properly, Hitler's face appears. Perfect!
(Here's what it looks like: http://web.utk.edu/~jrall/page_1/Allied_Propaganda.html)

Back to the story - Lemmy's walking towards me, I'm holding my copy of ""White Line Fever"" and my stupid gift. I call out ""Hey Lemmy!""
He shakes my hand and says Hi. He seemed a bit tired, probably just woke up I thought, but sincere and very friendly. 

I asked if he'd ever seen the ""5th Pig"" riddle before, he shook his head with a smile as he signed my book. I folded it and showed him the result. To my immense joy he cracked up and laughed really loudly! Success!
 I handed it to him, he folded it with a nod and smile and put it in his jacket pocket as he said ""Thanks mate!"" I took a few pictures with him, and off he went. 

That was the second, and last Mot√∂rhead show I'd gone to. And each time, they delivered 110%!!

I'm kind of glad that I never saw Mot√∂rhead in the later years. In my memory, Lemmy will always be in top shape (as healthy as he could be!) and I never got to see him as frail as he was towards the end.

Sorry for the long read, but I just had to share. 

Rest in peace Lemmy!

 You truly were legendary in every sense of the word, and will be severely missed by all.

I'm sure my story isn't as crazy as a lot of others out there, but I'm glad to say that I was lucky enough to meet the man himself.

Crank up some Mot√∂rhead as loud as you can as often as you can, and thanks for reading.

Anyone else have any stories to tell?

697,"Hi Shreddit, first time poster here.

Recently I've been reading about various musical subcultures through the ages (mods, punks, hippies, goths, emos and the like), how they arose, and how each inevitably declined and fell with time. In the midst of all these, heavy metal (and metalheads) seemed to stick out conspicously in the way that it stubbornly resists to wane and disappear to the extent that virtually every other subculture has. I supposed that the reason this was so, was because metal music (and metal culture) has a uniquely robust body of work on which it rests, a nigh indestructible Canon of Established and Indisputable Classics, comprising music so ridiculously good that we can all pretty much agree should be included in said canon, irrespective of whether it's our individual cup of tea or not. For example, I think most power metal fans wouldn't disagree that ""Transilvanian Hunger"" is a classic of extreme metal music, even if they don't personally care for it all that much. Likewise with black metal fans and say, ""The Divine Wings of Tragedy.""

This got me thinking about the idea of a Heavy Metal Canon, which got me thinking about the Metal Archives. Say what you will about the Archives (I know there's plenty of people with plenty to say about it) but one would be hard pressed to deny just how useful a tool it is for many metalheads around the world to discover new music in the Internet Age. It's practically indispensable for many, and some of the most interesting reviews (and, to be fair, some of the most mind-numbingly banal ones) have been written there over the years, by some really colorful personalities that didn't work for any magazine or publication, but just loved metal and had a keyboard and a modem. The more I thought about it, the more it seemed to me to be the perfect place to attempt to extract a Heavy Metal Canon. And so that's what I did.

The list I present to you today includes all of the albums which, as of December 31st, 2017, either currently has or at some point has had, **an average score of 90% from 10 or more reviews on the Metal Archives.** When I say ""at some point has had"", I mean that if the first 10 reviews average to, say, 94%, and the 11th reviewer gives the album a 0% (as people are wont to do on that site), causing the average to drop to 85%, that album is still included. This approach ensures that once an album makes it onto this list, it stays there for eternity.


A couple things: Yes, the Metal Archives is a site that is notorious for its crotchety elitism, but for the purposes of this list, I considered that to be an advantage rather than a drawback. After all, this list is supposed to represent music that is **universally** (or as close to universally as possible) acclaimed, elitist douchebags included. Like it or not, the fact is that such folk represent a real part of the fabric of the subculture. This crotchety elitism also serves to ensure the absence of even borderline nu metal/metalcore/other controversial subgenre, minimizing any potential ""but that's not metal"" cases in the list, although, as you'll see, there are still some of those.


As a side note, if the average for an album was 89.9, it was not included in the list. It's the computer scientist in me.


**tl;dr These are the most universally acclaimed metal albums of all time, according to some arbitrary math and the corner of the internet occupied by the Encyclopaedia Metallum users. This might be profoundly uninteresting to seasoned metalheads. But for someone new to metal, or someone exploring outside their preferred subgenre, I'd consider these to be ""can't go wrong""s. Maybe an alternative to the many excellent guides and primers already on this subreddit.**

Finally, a big thanks to www.furia.com/em/, a tool which proved incalculably useful in the creation of this list.

**EDIT:** ""Canon"" was definitely the wrong word to use here. Mea culpa everyone. It's plain to see that far too many of the undisputed essentials are just missing from here, Black Sabbath's self-titled for example (probably the most egregious one), but dozens of others as well. And others have pointed out the distinctly unscientific and statistically unsound methodology at work here, and this is completely true as well. Certainly the users of the Metal Archives hardly represent a random sampling of the metal listening population at large. The criteria I used (10 or more reviews and an average of 90% or higher) is entirely arbitrary as well. Perhaps, as one person suggested, the list would more accurately just be called ""popular on MA"".

That being said, I do like the idea of having a heavy metal canon, and I guess most any Greatest of All Time list is essentially an attempt to create something like one. This was a very rough and inexact attempt at creating one by what is essentially a popular vote, but a popular vote which requires a little more thought and effort than a mere vote (the thought and effort of writing a review, however troll-worthy). Ultimately it's probably a failed experiment. But it's one which I found fun to do, so I guess there's that :P"

&amp;nbsp;

In the world of Metal and Rock, the history of our beloved music has its roots in America, Europe, United Kingdom and more. However music is global and since Metal is outsider music, it is bound to spread in every continent. As a Middle Eastern guy from Oman, I at some point found the beauty of metal music at the age of 13 and kept exploring and here I am going to be 21 tomorrow. I always wondered that the scene in Arabic countries can easily explode due to many factors, but we aren't there yet, however here are a few bands that are either going strong or still trying to get their music across and get appreciation for their music.

&amp;nbsp;

1) If you are a fan of Nile and everything Egypt then I totally recommend the Egyptian band that comes from Cairo known as [Scarab,]( http://vicisolumrecords.com/track/pyramid-of-illusions) the first time I came across them was by chance as I was looking for technical sounding yet still old school sounding death metal and I was hit hard by the whole mix and sound of these guys.

&amp;nbsp;

2) When I say Pentagram, most likely you will be thinking of the American Doom band. I remember thinking that most of the bands I found were mostly extreme bands, but then I stumbled across the Turkish force called [Pentagram, also known as Mezarkabul]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XU_NIUOUrg) outside of Turkey. The band started as a Thrash band but soon developed into a more Heavy/ Prog metal band and is gaining quite the following.

&amp;nbsp;

Edit 2: I know Turkey isn't an Arabic country, yet I would still consider it a Middle eastern country but that is still debatable. This band still uses Middle eastern folk influences in their music. Here is the band [Myrath instead for your enjoyment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6GX5U42-mI)

&amp;nbsp;

3) This next band with no doubt got their name from the Death song Voice of the soul. The band features a melodious mix of death metal with hints of Prog metal along their sound as you can hear on the song [Quarantine](https://voiceofthesoul.bandcamp.com/track/quarantine) from their album Catacombs. The band is not from UAE as social media suggests, the members are from Lebanon and India but they reside in United Arab Emirates.

&amp;nbsp;

4) I recall at some point thinking what the sound of death, depression and despair sounds like. I have found yet another band that mixes black meta, but this time it was with doom. [The One man band known as Qafas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VT7gzNv8T_k) from Bahrain was a favourite of mine and at some point I got in contact with the guy behind it and we often talk from time to time. Mr. Omar 'Qafas' A is at this point in the process of writing another album. You can get some of his music on [Bandcamp]( https://rigorismprod-cdr.bandcamp.com/album/kafkaesque-retribution)

&amp;nbsp;

5) Another band from Bahrain that caught my attention is the Death/ Black Metal band [Smouldering in forgotten]( https://smoulderinginforgotten.bandcamp.com/track/dread-messiah) The band is a brutal force and they have toured a few times, their guitarist is an awesome person and down to earth.

&amp;nbsp;

6) Another band that is more on the Rock/ Heavy metal side is the [Palestenian band Khalas]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5TJMIKgclM) that once again mixes Middle eastern folk in their music but creates this upbeat sounding music with their riffs and melodies. As a fan of the Arabic legendary folk singer Fairouz I find this band very appealing.

&amp;nbsp;

7) This band got so much attention due to their controversial lyrics and I for one dont really relate to their anti-Islamic lyrics and such. However [Al-Namrood from Saudi Arabia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbV5rAmDmG4) was one of the first bands that I found when I was young and it was my cousin that showed me them since he is into a lot of underground bands. The band‚Äôs sound is still a great new idea that mixes Black metal with Middle Eastern guitar scales and folk instruments.

&amp;nbsp;

8) As I was writing this I did more research and came across a great band with a phenomenal sound that captures the essence of power metal and the speed of classic heavy metal, the band [Dragonrider]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbVNtabHjSM) from Jordan. The Power metal band might be lacking in discography but they are impressive nonetheless.

&amp;nbsp;

9) Just like how the grindcore band from Singapore Wormrot exploded in the underground scene, this next band I posted about before comes yet again from Saudi Arabia. The band [Creative waste]( https://creativewaste.bandcamp.com/track/the-lowborn) have played a few festivals including Obscene Extreme and are going to release a new album hopefully this year.

&amp;nbsp;

10) To end this list, last but not least is a band that I also found years ago as I was looking for Arabic bands and I came across the band [Acyl]( https://acylband.bandcamp.com/track/mercurial), A band that has both Algerian and French members. I recall hearing a song with Arabic chants and seeing that they came from Algeria, now I am no fan of Prog metal but I really admired their mix of Arabic folk and Metal.

&amp;nbsp;

I hope you all enjoyed this little piece I worked on and got turned to new bands that could one day shape a new wave of bands and spawn endless cool metal. Keep it true, if you are an Arab and in a band yourself, then feel to tell us more about your band in the comments. I might make a part 2 and write about more bands, maybe this time write about underground ones."

708,"I was talking with one of my friends the other night about how rough it is right now for most metal bands.  People are supporting the scene, but it's far easier to download an album than head down to the local store that carries metal, assuming there even is one where you live.  
A lot of us would like to put money directly into the bands hands if we could, so what would you think about setting up a jar at the merch booth/table at shows where you could drop in some cash if you downloaded the album but still wanted to pay the band for their hard work?  Is there any reason why something like this wouldn't work? (Logistically speaking, barring the discussion about whether people would actually use it or not)

Thought I'd share a story from the Toronto Alestorm gig I was at a couple months ago. 

I'm at the front of the crowd with a friend, patiently waiting for the first band. The guy beside me turns to me randomly and the following exchange ensues:

Guy: ""Why are you wearing a Decapitated shirt?""

Me: ""Why not?""

Guy: ""Because it's a bloody Alestorm show?""

Me: ""And? It's all metal.""

Guy: ""It's just something you don't wear to a show like this.""

Me: ""Really? I think it's something you completely should wear to a show like this. Seeing as this is a metal show, and this is a metal shirt.""

Guy: ""Why are you wearing a death metal shirt? It's an Alestorm show why not wear an Alestorm shirt?""

Me: (turning away at this point) ""Whatever man.""

I wonder for a couple minutes what that guy's problem was. Oh, and [this was the shirt](http://i.imgur.com/jXTqClT.jpg), for the record (if that matters at all).  So a couple hours in Alestorm finally comes on. About one song in I noticed: the guy who harassing me over my shirt was the keyboardist of Alestorm. I was pretty surprised. I mean, I'm showing an interest in his band's music by showing up to his concert. I've payed the money to see them play, supporting his band. How could he have the audacity to make such asinine comments about the fucking shirt I'm wearing? Why would he give a fan a hard time over something so trivial (and nonsensical)?

Am I overreacting do you think? Or is it justified to be a bit shocked/bothered by this experience?

797,"There have been a couple of pseudo primers here on the Indian metal bands, but I wanted to make one that was a little more up to date and a bit more inclusive. Thanks to u/Crucervix, u/Dragovic, u/deathofthesun, u/that_introverted_guy and others who helped me in writing something that can be considered somewhat coherent. This is the first time I have written something of this scope, so forgive me if its shit.

I am posting this at 3:00 here, so I will reply some time later.

The seeds of heavy metal music in India were sown during the late 80s, predominantly in the college scene because that‚Äôs the only place you could play metal without your parents trying to get you in therapy or making you a victim of religious intervention. In the beginning, it was just dudes with similar taste in music coming together to play covers of popular bands like Sabbath, Maiden, Metallica (The underground scene in the west was still pretty inaccessible to Indians due to various reasons covered in the rant section). But as the decade headed towards its twilight years, the bands were tired of being hacks and wanted to make original music. While Heavy Metal as a musical movement with a considerably big fanbase would take another 5-6 years to come into fruition, bands like Millennium from Bangalore and Post Mark form NE India started recording and releasing EPs of their original work. During this time Post Mark released their debut LP, the first of its kind by ant metal band in India. Due to a severe lack of suitable venues, distributers, promoters etc., the bands were mostly limited to performing live in the annual College festivals and some band showcases with very poor gear and a live sound (which was unintentional) potato enough give the Norwegian bands a run for their money. Although international acts began to notice the Indian market only after Iron Maiden came to India in 2007, the metal scene had been bursting at the seams since the mid-90s. Before that the metal tag was thrown around along with rock in the country, mocking the youngsters who deviated from the traditionally accepted (and mind-blowingly complicated) classical music and the braindead juggernaut that was Bollywood music, to pick up guitars turn up the distortion, turn the amps up to eleven and play shitty power chords. But with the demise of the 80s and birth of the 90s, heavy metal finally found its footing in India with the formation of what I (and literally no one else) call the unholy Triumvate (I just made this up because it sounds cool), three distinct regions across the Indian subcontinent spewing forth the most vile and repulsive (actually pretty tame if you ask me) metal. 

#**Mumbai and west India** 

Mumbai/Bombay is the only city in the west coast region that has any metal cred apart from New Delhi, competing with the southern part centered around Bangalore and Chennai for the most bands formed during the years 1995-2005. The scene was propelled into everlasting glory primarily by the Independence Rock festival held there every year created by Amit Sehgal based off Allahabad, which every millennial metalhead has a fond memory of. Amit Sehgal was one of the most important people in the scene, he started off in a band but then moved on to promotion and organizing. He then founded the Rock Street Journal, the first independent rock/metal magazine in the country, which also organized the Great Indian Rock, a multi city festival that did wonders for the scene promoting local acts but for the past couple of years has gone dormant. In addition to that the city also boasts some of the first ‚ÄúPurely‚Äù metal shows, held in a rundown church nonetheless and one of the more consistent early scene with venues like the Rang Bhavan and Rhinoceros Razzberry Bar both holding ‚ÄúMetal Nights‚Äù at least once a week, and much more recently the Hard Rock Caf√© there (to a much lesser extent). Here are some notable bands from the scene

**Demonic Resurrection** ‚Äì Weather it‚Äôs his constant bitching about the scene or him being arrogant and a little full of himself Sahil Makhija can be pretty polarizing. But he is the mastermind behind the most well-known band from India (amongst Indians that is, dunno how well they are received outside the country). They play a blend of symphonic black death heavily influenced by the likes of Dommi Burger, and to a lesser extent Emperor. Their discography is pretty progressive and they have grown from album to album quite a bit. It also features  one of the best Guitarists in India who can actually write interesting stuff, i.e. Nitish Hegde.

*[Death, Desolation and Despair]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsCABUlP-b8)

*[Frozen Portrait]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA6Ub88wrYs)


**Darkrypt** ‚Äì An OSDM influenced band playing some great, you guessed it Old School Death metal. Influenced by the likes of Nihihlist, Demigod, Funebre, Adramelech and the Swedish Death Metal scene, their latest LP was mastered by none other than Dan Swano. One of the few bands that sound fresh, sharp and can hold their own against a lot of international acts.

*[Chasm of Death]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e58FNwQDTHI)

*[Cryptic Illusions]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWjyCGISZYA)

**Carnage Inc** ‚Äì Old school thrash played with some crossover influences, resembling the 80s bay area sound (very Overkill-ish). These guys are fun to listen to with a very throwback vibe to their sound and riffs, in contrast to the countless shitty re-thrash bands here.

*[Deflied]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vvrkMfv9YY)


**Aghor Andhakar** ‚Äì Nazi Socialist Black Metal, yup you read that right. An Indian dude with right wing extremist ideologies, global village FTW(For those who still don‚Äôt belive it [here]( https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiS2eCSg9TVAhVLLo8KHTzeCWsQFggnMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FAghor-Andhkar-185749684782658%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNF37eboUs7FfLU7TQ_KHO6GPBnMYQ) is the band‚Äôs facebook). All jokes aside this is a pretty decent (intentionally) potato one man black metal project from New Delhi. Inspired by the rawer Norwegian bands, the dude plays a very Dark Funeral-ish black metal still rooted strongly in the early second wave, contrary to what the bands like Sinister Violence or Cosmic Infusion do with addition of symphonic elements.

*[Aghor Andhakar ‚Äì Invading Motherland]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSH5ReMvmXw)

**1883 AD** ‚Äì Melodic black metal inspired by the Norwegian bands, Emperor, Burzum and Immortal with the last one‚Äôs influence being the most obvious. They are one of the handful of bands that play pure black metal, a genre that doesn‚Äôt seem to have a lot of quality bands here inspite of having a sizeable Black Metal audience and musicians. The band members are influenced by everyone from shred gods like Tony Mac Alpine, Steve Vai, Joe Satriani to the aforementioned black metal bands and everything in between, and this shows through in their compositions, with catchy, melodic almost thashy hooks, Indian Carnatic music inspired leads and riffs, especially in the passages.

*[Who will kill the Emperor]( https://1833ad.bandcamp.com/track/who-will-kill-the-emperor-2)

*[Sephiroth‚Äôs Curse]( https://1833ad.bandcamp.com/track/sephiroths-curse)

**Solar Diety** ‚Äì Drawing influences heavily from the likes of Marduk and Dark Funeral, these guy(s) play Satanic Black metal. The band started off as a one man show, with Aditya Mehta writing all the music himself but now has a second guitarist, so things have gotten a bit more interesting in terms of songwriting and composition. 

*[Through the hallways of Narak]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sf9tZtzvv8)

*[Circling the moon]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sf9tZtzvv8)

**Primitiv** ‚Äì A sludgy death metal band, featuring members from Albatross, Hellwind, Reptilian Death and Blood Meridian. They have just one full length out but they seem to have a really promising future, with crushing riffs and slow dirge-y songs. 

*[World war zero]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suvDOXeZOm8)


**Albatross** ‚Äì These guys were in close contention for the extremely prestigious ‚ÄúBest Band from the country‚Äù title that I assign to an eternally glorified band. Another trad outfit that has turned into a beast of its own. Fronted by __ on soaring operatic vocals and impeccable fretwork courtesy of Nitish Hegde, they are heavily influenced by the early 80s traditional sound, primarily King Diamond, while not sounding like shitty ripoffs and making great original music.

*[A tale of two tyrants]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_t02vdVz7c)

*[Uncle sunny at the tavern]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqRrOEWEbyQ)


**Toxoid** ‚Äì Black metal bands from Delhi, primarily inspired by the likes of (Pest era) Gorgoroth, oscillating between mid paced marches and blistering tremolo riffs, these guys go straight for the jugular with a very Darkthrone-y sound with hints of the faster Norwegian bands. 

*[Aurora Satanae]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x49tV9KKUdM)

*[Demon Lust]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBA7URBcLy4)


**Killchain** ‚Äì An OSDM band, heavily influenced by the likes of Bolt Thrower and the Swedish bands.

*[Screaming from the Laybirnth]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0GrVYgnxJ4)



The Mumbai scene was one of the frontrunners of the movement here, along with the scene in the North East and the South and also hosted the first pure black metal show in the form of Black Metal Krieg. And in trying to find stuff about that [North Eastern] scene online has made me realize that either the North East was better at iron curtaining than USSR or people were too fucking high and drunk to give a flying fuck about documenting anything. I am gonna go with the latter because of meticulous observations that I have made regarding metalheads from that region, which is, they are drunk and high as fuck, most of the time and they don‚Äôt seem to give a shit. But in all seriousness that part of the country has been unstable for quite some time, with inaccessibility due to its geography further hindering any contact with the other states easy. The Northeastern part of the country along with the city of Kolkata, had a distinct band centered (playing primarily hard and pop rock) movement with quite a few DIY live shows in Kolkata which are now mostly stuff of myths and significantly large and more professional shows in the NE (mostly in Imphal and Shillong) with very good musicians. Sadly I cannot find much about this scene beyond these few vague details. Apparently there were quite a few metal bands formed along with Post Mark but they dissolved without any trace and even their music is probably lost for ever.

#**Bangalore and South India**

Now that we have analyzed the infestation of metal in the home of Bollwood itself, we shall traverse south of the haven. The southern scene was centered mainly around Bangalore and Chennai, both home to the silicon revolution in India (Bangalore more so, Chennai to a much lesser extent), which had young, wet behind the ears dudes coming to a city whose language and culture was pretty alien to them. Now think about it, a ton of new young guys, who have musical influences ranging from Led Zeppelin to Darkthrone feeling lonely in a big city, who do they turn to ? If you said the warm, loving embrace of alcohol, you are correct. Considering the fact that the club/bar scene is probably the strongest here (the popular venues are listed in the WDIGFMITC section) that approximation might not be that far fetched. The IT boom was centered around Bangalore which turned it into a potpourri of cultures that in turn probably fueled the metal shitstorm that would engulf the city in the 2000s, with a multitude of quality bands forming along with a strong backbone in the form of a rigid performance circuit, that would be critical in making the city (arguably. Shillong makes a compelling case) the metal capital of the country.


**Millennium** ‚Äì One of the first metal band from India and one of the best. Playing thrash with some influence from King Diamond/Mercufyl Fate (which is kind of apparent in the ‚ÄúOnly be One‚Äù video). These guys are probably the only ones who have been around literally from the beginning of the scene, and reformed recently with almost all the original members with Rohit Chaturvedi from Kyptos handling lead duties, hopefully even in the future (no official source just speculating) studio albums.

*[Only be one]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj4MeQngs2c)

*[Final Sign]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQDKC-TXvSU)

*[Grey]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nq5VpB0CAc)

**Purvaja** ‚Äì Vedic Black Metal, another one man black metal project. Although a little amateurish and rough around the edges, he composes some of the best mixtures of Indian intrumentals and black metal, with a slight hint of carnatic tunes in his riffs.  	

*[Ghor Tapasya (Intense meditation)]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob_kVdq7TGc)

*[Kali Tandav]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oc8aOQIwkBg)

**Kryptos** ‚Äì AKA the best fucking band in the country, they play an awesome mix of trad and hints of thrash, and write the best riffs in the country, they have been together for close to 20 years now and have an almost flawless discography with a couple of albums marred by poor production. Although their music can be a little formulaic sometimes it is not necessarily a bad thing (especially live, they absolutely kill it live). They regularly tour Europe with absolute fucking legends (played a show with fucking Vicious Rumors and motherfucking Tank) so be sure to catch them, because if I forgot to mention, they have a great live show as well.

*[Starfall]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlSPfmKd14M) 

*[Mask of Anubis]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSaSw3dH5Y8)

*[Serpent Mage]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsG-P5WxDv8)

**Bevar Sea** ‚Äì Doom metal from Bangalore, drawing heavy influences from the early trad Doom bands like Black Sabbath, Pentagram, Cathedral, their music is almost worship-py, heavy on the fuzz and low on the tempo, these guys might be a bit generic but are pretty damn enjoyable. The best amongst the Doom bands here IMO.

*[Universal Sleeper]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9zwQten7Cw)

*[Where there‚Äôs a smoke there‚Äôs a pyre]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naacR2F1S3Q)


**Dwesha** ‚Äì Crushing death metal from Kerela, channeling the fury of acts like Asphyx and Bolt Thrower these guys make some of the heaviest metal in the country. Their lyrical content is heavy influenced by traditional Indian legends and folk tales. They also stay away from the djent/core influences which again helps in maintaining a consistent quality.

*[Kapala Hara]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxquuX6uJfY)

**Moksha** ‚Äì Another one of the old guard, formed in the mid 90s, these guys played heavy metal influenced by the NWOBHM bands and were huge fans of Iron Maiden, being featured in a tribute compilation to the band featuring artists from all over the world.  Sadly the band called it quits after the death of their vocalist.

*[Dine with the Devil]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFZ7G6ThZ1U)

 

**Abaddon** -  A great throwback heavy/thrash band playing a little more mid paced thrash in contrast to bands like Devoid, Carnage Inc who opt to go for the faster route. Drawing influence from bands like Coroner and the early Bay area thrash bands.

*[Violent Sage]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebJmPwiWTjY)

*[Bulleteye]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpnRZa_ZWUc )

**Against Evil** ‚Äì A traditional metal band but with a more ‚Äúneo‚Äù, cleaner sound than the likes of Albatross or Falcun or Kryptos. A bit cheesy but they have a lot of heart and good songwriting.

*[Stand up and fight]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO12RdnW7YY)

*[The Enemy within]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHLtI5ArhGg)

**Sharpnel** ‚Äì A ‚Äúmodern‚Äù thrash band that is disbanded as of now.  

*[Eternal Wat]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFAGNjKmEOw)

*[Hammer Blow]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUs5XK103Rg)

**Dying Embrace** ‚Äì Another of the old guard, these guys have been around for ages, and their members are also pretty active in the back end of the scene nowadays. They are probably the first band from the country to go for a more doom oriented death metal rather than just straight up OSDM.

*[Blood Rites]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gPmpPnCGnU)


#**Kolkata and the North Eastern states**
Both the city of Kolkata and the North Eastern scene had been producing original outfits performing covers and even original material since the late 70s and 80s, which resembled hard rock/rock n roll more closely than metal. But none of them seemed to find a lot of popularity outside their state, fading into the shadows before the internet could have a significant impact on their legacy. I don‚Äôt think that even the physical copies that they put out would be available in the market. As we are talking about the super early metal scene, it should be noted that the NE states probably had a full fledged metal scene before the rest of the cities caught up but that is nearly impossible to confirm. The North Eastern scene primarily consists of Death/Black metal bands, perhaps a reflection of the tough conditions they face in their daily lives, starting with being geographically isolated from the mainland and then most of the NE states being ignored by politicians and activists alike and suffering from very poor infrastructure and development. In spite of such shortcomings, they have a music ecosystem that probably puts every other city combined in the country to shame. With bands continuously touring the country or performing domestically in the handful of festivals that are organized there to the loyal and hardworking fans. NE fans are probably some of the more hardcore ones in the country, gravitating towards the more extreme genres than others and constantly working to support their scene.

**Heathen Beast (Kolkata)**  ‚Äì Probably the best Black (now blackened grindcore) outfit from the country. With lyrical content reflecting their name, they constantly address issues that any other msucial group wouldn‚Äôt dare to even hint at. They fuse traditional black metal with indigenous instrumentals, channeling a chaotic sonic fury that no one can even come close to replicating.

*[If the army can do it, so can you]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTR2nwkDNmQ)

*[Rise of the saffron empire]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSHgVD5rsFM)

*[Fuck poor people, I have PayTM]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7YfeD2_Rpg)


**Gypsy** ‚Äì One of the younger bands formed in the city of Kolkata, Gypsy play very upbeat heavy metal that seems to be heavily influenced by the rock n roll bands of the 60s and 70s with some indigenous instrumentals thrown in the mix to spice it up, highly recommended.

*[Gimme your load]( https://gypsyindia.bandcamp.com/track/gimme-your-load)

*[Turned into stone]( https://gypsyindia.bandcamp.com/track/turned-into-stone)

*[The Shoemaker]( https://gypsyindia.bandcamp.com/track/the-shoemaker)

**Armament** ‚Äì Another thrash outfit inspired by the early thrash bands, their sound borrowing heavily from the Teutonic trinity, and a little hint of the South American scene, especially with the vocals.

*[Chaos Prevails]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyDSfYtVK5E)

*[Gas Chamber]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd49d3iHGF8)

Falcun ‚Äì A very young band playing traditional metal, they have an EP out and an album is in the works.

**Cosmic Infusion** ‚Äì Symphonic black metal band influenced again by the likes of Emperor, Dommi Burger, Marduk, Darkthrone and Bathory. But they mostly limit their style to the first two.

**Tetragrammacide** ‚Äì I honestly don‚Äôt get these guys or the genre they play, but they are pretty much loved here and have garnered a lot of respect both at home and on the international level, so I decided to include them for people who like Noise/war stuff.

*[Typhonian Wormholes EP]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I0w86kF6lE)


**Aguares** ‚Äì Raw Hellhammer-ish black metal from the North East, they are a pretty recent band and almost border on the War side of black metal sometimes. No bullshit, harsh, riffy black metal. 

*[Storm of satanic cult]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JquojBahAac)

**Insane Prophecy** ‚Äì Great Black/Black Death black metal trio, that started off as a 5 piece symphonic project and morphed into the beast today after the exit of their keyboard player. The vocals can be a little off putting, but the riffs and songwriting are on point.

819,"Hi Shreddit,

EDIT: I work at a small private high school and want to offer students a look at a topic of great personal importance and interest, and hopefully exposing them to some new music that they can enjoy.

I'm starting an elective class at my school about the history of metal.  The students on my roster have a pretty mixed background, but my impression before we start is that most of them have little to no exposure to the music.  I'm going to spend a lot of time on why they're in the class, how I personally got into the music, and why we should care, before getting into the history content and listening to music.  Currently planning on giving them about 45 minutes of listening each week for them to delve into and give an overview of the era.

I'm particularly interested in feedback about the sequencing I put together for studying the various movements and how they fit together.  General commentary about the class and key points to hit about the subculture and significance of the music are also welcome.  I figure this subreddit is full of people who are more knowledgeable about this than I am so who better to help me tweak?

EDIT: Revised to better include doom

My current plan is this:
Week 1: What is heavy metal? What do we know? Who are we as metal fans?  Roots of the music and ‚Äúmetal family tree.‚Äù 60s heavy rock and the first heavy metal bands. The Kinks, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Rainbow, Judas Priest.

Week 2: NWOBHM.  Saxon, Angel Witch, Venom, Motorhead, Iron Maiden. Metal in the mainstream and development of glam. Van Halen, Def Leppard, Guns ‚Äòn‚Äô Roses.

Week 3: Parallel development of power metal and doom metal in both the US and Europe.  Helloween, Iced Earth, Manowar, Savatage, Blind Guardian, Hammerfall, St Vitus, Witchfinder General, Candlemass.

Week 4-5: Thrash metal and crossover thrash. Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax, Exodus, Kreator, D.R.I., S.O.D., increasingly dark and extreme music. Roots of death metal and more extreme genres borrowing from crossover. More in-depth look at Slayer, Hellhammer, Mercyful Fate, Venom, Celtic Frost and other early extreme bands.

Week 6-7: Death metal. Florida and Gothenburg scenes, compare and contrast.  Crossover influences on grindcore. Obituary, Possessed, Death, Morbid Angel, Napalm Death, Carcass, Suffocation, Cannibal Corpse, Entombed, At The Gates, In Flames, Vader, Bloodbath.

Week 7-8: Black metal. Bathory, Mayhem, Emperor, Darkthrone, Burzum, Immortal, Dissection, Master's Hammer.  Spread of the style to other regions.

Week 9-10: Other parallel and crossover genres. Doom, folk, progressive, groove metal.  Modern developments, globalization, nu-metal and ‚Äúcore‚Äù crossovers.  Sepultura, Pantera, Eluveitie, St. Vitus, Candlemass, Katatonia, Converge, Hatebreed, Opeth‚Ä¶ 2015/16 in metal. Final projects!"

829,"This subreddit is mostly good, but as much as I love youtube links to metal songs, it doesn't really lend it self to much discussion imo. Posting tours could start up discussion about the quality of a bands live show, potential meetups in whatever cities the bands are playing or just stories from seeing them live. Not only that but the absolute best way to really help out a band is to go to see them live and buying merch.

I want to thank all the bands I've seen for playing with such passion and conviction despite the utter dearth of money in this genre. I want to thank all the promoters for putting together bills that not only put my favourite acts on but also introducing me to new ones. I want to thank the record labels for supporting bands I love in ways I couldn't possibly manage. 

You guys are the reason I put up with all the bullshit. Every day I get accused of worshipping Satan or eating babies because I wear an Iron Maiden t-shirt. I explain why they're wrong, but they don't want to listen. They just want to stroke their egos and put down the guy who's not afraid to be passionate about something mildly alternative. So many people seem to be just content with passing through life, not finding anything to truly love, and it saddens me. 

Everything about heavy metal: The music, the showmanship, the musicianship, the camaraderie, the community and the history makes me happy. I love you all. God help me if I didn't have the internet, knowing there are so many like me.

So have a hug from me. Drink a beer, put on your favourite band and be happy you're part of such a welcoming and rewarding community. Thanks for reading \,,/"

It contains rare pre-release mixes of five songs, including ""Pictures of Matchstick Men"" with Peter Steele on vocals instead of Ozzy Osbourne.

Last year, a studio copy of the tape, labeled by Peter Steele, was auctioned off on eBay. 
It sold for $800. 

Earlier, one of the Type O Negative family was generous enough to post the entire October Rust demo tape on youtube for all who care to hear.

Greetings. As we have done in the past, the eve before the Top X vote is devoted to martialish law for the subreddit in what people want to see. While not entirely democratic, the [Banned &amp; Restricted Discussions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/84lwxc/shreddits_official_banned_restricted_discussion/) provide active users a chance to moderate what is seen on the sub. With that said, any grievance or addition can be brought up at those quarterly discussions.  The mods then take these discussions and decide among themselves what gets banned, restricted, and jokingly blacklisted for a whole year.

##Banned: Sepultura, In Flames 

This is the easy one. Sepultura had enough mentions combined with one of the mods yelling Roots at the Sizzler to warrant a blanket ban. In Flames was problematic enough when Restricted to go back into the clink. When we reform our restricted criteria, In Flames maybe able to come out but maybe not ever. 

##Restricted: Sodom, 3 Inches of Blood, Gorguts, Red Fang, Skeletonwitch

* Sodom - It was Agent Oranges fault. This band has more material than 1 album. 

* Gorguts: A preventative measure to address a silent trend among tech death and OSDM fans. 

* 3 Inches of Blood: This is the fault of a popular surge despite shitty live recording to earn them a few months in the drunk tank. 

* Red Fang / Skeletonwitch: Both bands are coming off of the banned list to the Restricted list in effort from one of our progressive mods to use the Banned list as a final solution and restricted list as a more flexible fix. Red Fang is dominated by three songs (Wires, Prehistoric Dog, Hank is Dead) and can easily be regulated by barring them. Skeletonwitch is more nebulous since their popular songs are dispersed throughout their discography and their name carries a legacy of blind upvoting. Please see the below second ""GOING FORWARD"" for information on material affected by the restriction. 

#Going Forward

I love this phrase as I have seen it used by companies when they release a shitty DLC or have their product leaked to the public ruining spoiler season. 

As per discussion yesterday, we want to make the restricted list more streamlined and easy for users to know what is okay and what is not. The idea is to have the restricted list comprised of 1-2 albums that are barred and the Banned List used when the there not a logical fix. Metallica, Black Sabbath and legacy bands have name recognition plus a wide discography while In Flames has only a few albums of material even relevant to metal. 

At this moment **we do not have written rules of what is okay and what is not for Restricted bands.** We are going to draft a list to see if we can make these rules easier and when it is done put it in a wiki linked to the side bar. The old (and still relevant) rule was the top 50 songs of all time on Last.fm as well  which sometimes leads to things corner cases and intro songs falling on the list. If this is confusing please know the mods will use a tier system of *A) Personal Discretion B) Popular Songs C) Popular Albums D) Last Time Posted*  to make the final decision. 


#Watchlist 

These are the bands that we are keeping an eye on that were brough up this and last discussion. We want to keep your wishes in mind when doing these announcements and while we may not be able to band every band you hate, we can give you rubber band gun and a wooden star to go arrest wrong doers.

890,"G'day all,
 
Some of you might remember me as the guy doing the PhD on Aussie Extreme metal. I wanted to write a series of posts acting as a primer for Aussie metal as a whole and then some more specific styles; I've just done a literature review of the academic literature on Australian metal, so here's a 'literature review' of the musical literature if you like. I hope that this helps people discover some of the amazing bands we have here, and perhaps helps some of the more experienced folk find new bands! I'd like to give a big thanks to everyone who responded to my posts a few months ago giving suggestions for Australian bands. A special shout-out goes to u/AveLucifer in particular for a huge amount of help suggesting bands, making suggestions on the structure and Lo-Fi Black metal and potentially co-writing some later sections of this.
 
Here's how the posts will be structured (links to be provided as the posts are written):
 
1: An introduction to Australian metal, and the big bands that sound like other bands [This Post]
 
2: [Developing Australian metal: Origins, traditional bands and Aussie thrash](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/8so1d0/developing_australian_metal_origins_traditional/)
 
3: Aussie Prog/melodeath
 
4: Aussie death/grind
 
5: Aussie war, 'blackslash' (black/death/thrash/etc. hybrids) and lo-fi BM
 
6: QLD Occult bands
 
The idea is that people can get a broad overview of Aussie metal, but can also jump into the sections that discuss specific styles or bands that they like or are interested in. Please note that this means that some of our really important and excellent bands will be covered in later posts, so please don't jump down my throat yelling that I forgot X band. ^^^You ^^^can ^^^do ^^^that ^^^after ^^^the ^^^final ^^^post.  I'm going to give each band that I discuss a 'FFO' recommendation to help situate them with bands you might know. Some of our really big bands that I expect most people to know will also include an 'If I liked this Aussie band, I might also like the following Aussie band(s)' to try and connect people with some of the lesser-known bands in various styles. I'd love for people in the comments to add to sections like this if they can, because I certainly don't know every band and would love to connect people with more great music that they love.
 
As an aside, I'm not intending to cover our deathcore/metalcore bands in this series of posts, because I personally think those fall outside the purview of metal and, in my experience, the two scenes are relatively separate. This means bands such as Thy Art is Murder, Parkway Drive, Northlane, Amity Affliction etc. won‚Äôt be covered here (though, if you're into that style, those bands aren't a bad place to start).
 
With that out of the way, let's get going!

Metal has something of a unique context in Australia. One of the things people who haven't been here don't often realise is that Australia is huge and quite remote. Most of the population live in the big cities on the eastern coast: approximately 80% of the population lives in Canberra (the federal capital), Sydney, Melbourne or Brisbane. There's a big desert in the middle, meaning that the western half of the country is quite isolated from the east, and even cities like Darwin, Hobart and Adelaide are pretty removed from the rest of the country. Even on the Eastern coast, it's approximately 1800km from Melbourne to Brisbane, which is barely halfway up the Eastern coast. Sydney to Melbourne is approximately 880km, going up to 974km if you go via Canberra. Isolated within itself, Australia is pretty hard to get to from other places in the world as well, unless that place is New Zealand or somewhere in SE Asia.
 
You may be wondering at this point why I've interrupted my post on metal to give you a geography lesson. This is actually one of the biggest factors I've come across in my research for why Australian metal is the way it is. Australian metal bands mention it pretty frequently in [interviews](http://www.invisibleoranges.com/metal-scene-report-australia/), because it makes touring pretty difficult for newer bands, both within the country and internationally, though the advent of online sharing has made spreading music somewhat easier for bands. As a result, most Australian metal is pretty hybridised: scenes aren't big enough (and there aren't enough of them) to have dedicated death metal, thrash metal, black metal scenes all over the place, so heaps of our bands end up playing hybrid forms of black/thrash/death etc. rather than dedicating themselves to a single style. When you compare this to examples of specific city-based scenes like Tampa, Stockholm, Gothenburg, you see that Australia doesn't really have anything like this. I'm sure you'll notice looking through these posts that the vast majority of our bands fit more than one genre, or perform in a genre that is already something of a hybrid (e.g. war metal). This isn't to say Aussie scenes are tiny and almost non-existent, quite the opposite, but they tend not to have the genre specificity that other scenes might have.
 
As a result, there's not really a clear 'Australian sound' that is immediately obvious in the same way that there's a Stockholm sound, a Bay-Area sound or a Gothenburg sound. There are a few things that people often mention when they talk about Aussie metal: they often say we're hybridised (as mentioned above); they often consider it to be comparatively more extreme or 'brutal' than similar bands from other nations; and we often put a fair amount of 'Australian-ness' in our music in terms of culture, our infamous sense of humour etc. Note that this is a pretty broad and complex topic that I'm not going to really go into here (I've got to save that for my PhD) but it might give you some ideas of what people see as being 'characteristic' of Australian metal.
 
The remoteness and difficulty with touring have some other impacts: many bands can't make a career out of touring. There's only so many times you can hit up the big east-coast towns after all. Oddly, some of our big bands almost ONLY existed as live bands, especially those on the east coast. To give an example, Slaughter Lord, one of our most significant bands that are cited as an influence by bands such as Bathory and At the Gates NEVER recorded a studio album. Their material was released years after they broke up by drummer Steve Hughes (more famous to some as a comedian) in the form of a compilation disc that collected some demos and two studio tracks. This is somewhat common for bands kicking off in the 80s - you might see a fair few 80s bands in the next post that have been active since 1984 but released their first album in 2015. Most of our bands that became super successful (particularly before the internet) did so via international labels and huge popularity in international scenes (for example, Mortification‚Äôs HUGE popularity in US Christian metal circles). Furthermore, some of our scenes get pretty incestuous in terms of band member sharing, with many of the occult QLD bands sharing members, though there are plenty of examples in other scenes too (special mention to Matt 'Skitz' Sanders for being in heaps of significant Aussie bands if you have a look at his ['past bands' tab](https://www.metal-archives.com/artists/Matt_%22Skitz%22_Sanders/353)).
 
Hopefully, this gives you some context for the way that sound of the bands have developed through the years. The next post is going to focus more on the historical-musical development of Australian metal, so for now, let's get into some music from our really big bands.

These bands aren't really connected by anything other than relative popularity. While later posts will deal with bands on a more genre/scene-based organisation, these ones should give you an introduction to some of our tried and true bands in a variety of styles. Bands that broke up and then reformed under a new name are indicated with a slash.

**Mortification**

Genre: Death/Thrash

FFO: Tampa-style death metal (Morbid Angel, Death, Obituary), early Living Sacrifice

Start with: *Scrolls of the Megilloth* (1992)

MA: https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Mortification/792
 
Often cited as our best-selling band, largely due to immense popularity with US Christian metal scenes and a record deal from Nuclear Blast. Though they started as a power metal band called LightForce, they quickly shifted to a much heavier thrash/death style. The first three albums - *Mortification* (1991), *Scrolls* (1992) and *Post-Momentary Affliction* (1993) - highlight some pretty excellent examples of this style and are generally quite well regarded even outside of Christian scenes. Sadly, things gradually take a turn for the worse after this. The shift in vocal style seen on *Affliction* is present on the follow-up albums and the songwriting gradually decays. This coincides with bassist/vocalist/songwriter Steve Rowe's diagnosis with leukaemia, and many of the lyrical themes in the middle albums reflect his struggle with the disease and faith but without the excellent music behind it. More recent work, such as the *Scribe of the Pentateuch* EP (2012) and *Realm of the Skeletaur* (2015) reflects a bit more of a return to form, though Rowe has reportedly retired from Christian music, resulting in some uncertainty about the future of the band.
 
If I liked this Aussie band I might like the following Aussie bands: 

 
**Discarnated**: An interesting spin on Christian death metal from Adelaide retaining the gory lyrics characteristic of the genre. *Deus Misereatur* (1993) is a decent album in a similar vein to Mortification.

 
**Horde**: Side project of drummer Jason Sherlock, Horde is notable as one of the first 'unblack' metal releases with 1994's *Hellig Usvart*. While Horde are clearly mocking the Norwegian BM scene (with Sherlock calling himself 'Anonymous' as a play on Euronymous), the music shows some authenticity for the BM style and aesthetic and is worth a look. 
 
-- 
**Mournful Congregation**
 
Genre: Funeral Doom
 
FFO: Bell Witch, Thergothon, Ahab, Skepticism
 
Start with: *The Incubus of Karma* (2018) or *The Monad of Creation* (2005)
 
MA: https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Mournful_Congregation/2824
 
A commenter on reddit (u/ParaTC I think?) described them as 'Funeral doom for people who don't like Funeral doom‚Äô, which I think, is a great way to put it. While slower genres like doom are not usually my cup of tea, this is crushingly heavy but still infused with quite a lovely sense of melody. While their Australian touring seems to have been somewhat limited, they've toured Europe somewhat more frequently (though they performed live for the first time in 2009). A band that keeps many of their details deliberately obscure, they also share members with StarGazer, Martire and Cauldron Black Ram. 2011's *The Unspoken Hymns* is a compilation of their early vinyl work that can give you a better idea of their early work if you're interested, but they've got a pretty strong discography overall.
 
If I liked this Aussie band I might like the following Aussie bands:
 
**Cryptal Darkness/The Eternal**: A more gothic take on the doom style, though the earlier work as Cryptal Darkness is death/grind. 
 
**Elysian Blaze**: Mixing some black in with the funeral doom, their *Blood Geometry* (2012) was very well received and they appear to have a new album on the horizon.
 
**Abysmal Sorrow**: Another black/funeral doom band that have unfortunately split up. The self-titled compilation released in 2014 contains all released material.
 
--
**Abramelin** 

Genre: Death
 
FFO: Deicide, Entombed, Misery, Cemetery Urn
 
Start with: *Abramelin* (1995)
 
MA: https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Abramelin/2826
 
Originally called 'Acheron', Abramelin are one of Australia's most legendary death metal acts. With a heavy debt to both US and European death metal styles in their sound, they play some excellent death metal with lyrics that are pretty extreme even by most death metal standards. While this led to them copping some flak from the Western Australian government in the form of a ban, they kept up a strong release and well-respected live presence. While their discography may look somewhat unimpressive, their influence can't be understated, and former members have also featured in Blood Duster, King Parrot and diSEMBOWELMENT. Though they broke up in 2002, they recently reformed in 2016 and have been playing some shows with a fairly star-studded line-up of Aussie metal greats. A compilation EP was released in 2013 that covers their career.
 
If I liked this Aussie band I might like the following Aussie bands:
 
**Cemetery Urn**: A much murkier sound than Abramelin, producing some twisty riffs reminiscent of the best of Swedish DM mixed with Incantation. Last year's self-titled album is worth looking into, as is much of their earlier work. What Abramelin might have been if they'd gotten into Incantation instead of Deicide. 
 
**Depravity**: An excellent up-and-coming band playing some great death metal that reminds me very much of a modern Abramelin. Their recent release *Evil Upheaval* (2018) has shown up on reddit a few times and is very much worth checking out as a personal AotY contender. 
 
--
 
**Destr√∂yer 666**
 
Genre: Black/Thrash
 
FFO: Absu, Nifelheim, Sodom, Nocturnal Graves
 
Start with: *Unchain the Wolves* (1997) or *Cold Steel for an Iron Age* (2002)
 
MA: https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Destr%C3%B6yer_666/223
 
Another renowned Australian band, Destr√∂yer 666 are (in)famous mostly for putting out some genre-defining blackened thrash, but will be known to some for the more recent antics of lead singer K.K. Warslut. That aside, there is some excellent material throughout most of their discography. The two suggested start points listed above are more of a personal choice, you could pretty safely pick any release from 1994-2003 and get something good. Later material isn't bad in my opinion but doesn't quite hold up to the classic material, though 2016's Wildfire was well received. Though the band is sometimes associated with war metal (given Warslut's previous tenure in Bestial Warlust), calling them war metal would be something of a misnomer in my opinion. Notably, they're a big Australian band that have felt the need to leave Australia owing to the lack of opportunity, having relocated to The Netherlands and London in the past (though they've made a recent return to Australia). 
 
 
If I liked this Aussie band I might like the following Aussie bands:
 
**Denouncement Pyre**: With a bit more of a blackened/thrasy edge to the death metal sound, Denouncement Pyre put forward some pretty huge riffs. Their recent release *Black Sun Unbound* (2016) features a straightforward black/thrash/death in the vein of Destr√∂yer 666 with some cleaner production.
 
**Nocturnal Graves**: Very well respected in the black/thrash arena, recent showings have included some elements of death in the mix as well. *Titan* (2018) was released a few weeks ago to pretty high praise, as was 2013's *From the Bloodline of Cain*.
 
-- 

**diSEMBOWELMENT/Inverloch**
 
Genre: Death/doom
 
FFO: Dusk, Spectral Voice, Thergothon
 
Start with: *Transcendence into the Peripheral* (1993), Inverloch: *Dusk|Subside* (EP 2012)
 
MA: https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Disembowelment/4213; https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Inverloch/3540344841
 
Chances are that if you're familiar with death/doom, or even just doom you've run into diSEMBOWELMENT at some point. It's a bit hard to overstate how influential their 1993 album was for the genre and for good reason, it's fantastic. A great sense of atmosphere combined with some solid riffing. Inverloch originally formed as d.USK performing bits of the diSEMBOWELMENT back catalogue, though they gradually became their own band. While falling more on the doom side of things, the elements that made diSEMBOWELMENT great are still present and they're very much worth checking out. There's also a side project called Trial of the Bow that features members of both bands and is some pretty chill folk music.
 
If I liked this Aussie band I might like the following Aussie bands:
 
**The Nihilistic Front**: As with Inverloch, falling more on the doom side, but still pretty heavy. Worth a look if this is your kind of music. Their *Procession to Alienation* (2013) reminds me somewhat of Spectral Voice as well.
 
--

**Misery**
 
Genre: Death
 
FFO: Abramelin, Morta Skuld
 
Start with: *Revel in Blasphemy* (1997)
 
MA: https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Misery/2239
 
Suggested by some as being Australia's first ""proper"" death metal band (though Abramelin had formed as Acheron in 1988), Misery hail from Brisbane and set the stage somewhat for many of Australia's death metal to follow. While their first album *A Necessary Evil* (1993) shows some brief flirtations with grind and doomy elements, the second album *Revel in Blasphemy* (1997) showcases a bit more of their sound and was the album that gave them a reputation nation-wide. Both are great albums, with *Necessary* having a crushingly murky sound and *Blasphemy* having more of an OSDM feel in the riffing and being a bit more focused stylistically. Vocalist issues plagued the bands through their early years and though they originally broke up in 2001, they reformed last year.
 
If I liked this Aussie band I might like the following Aussie bands:
 
More or less the same picks as Abramelin. diSEMBOWLMENT are a fairly logical progression if you enjoyed the more doomy vibe that *Necessary* has going on. Aussie death/grind will be covered in a later post.
 
--

**Manticore** 

Genre: Death (Not to be confused with the war metal band of the same name)
 
FFO: Thrashy OSDM
 
Start with: *Integrating the Extreme* (1996)
 
MA: https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Manticore/5932
 
A short-lived band from Wagga Wagga, Manticore nonetheless put out two fantastic albums in the mid-90s, one of which features Darren Goulding of Misery. There's a thrashy bent to some of their death metal, mostly evident in the speed at which most of it is played and a cover of 'Raining Blood' as a hidden track on *Integrating the Extreme*. Steve Watts also featured in Frakenbok and Terrorlust for a while and made some vague comments about plans for Manticore around their 25th anniversary in 2015, but nothing much seems to have come from that. Definitely worth a look though!
 
If I liked this Aussie band I might like the following Aussie band(s):
 
**Antichrist**: Suggested by u/AveLucifer on a Manticore post, similar vein with more of a Black Metal styling. Not a lot of material (a demo and two splits) but worth having a look at.
 
--

**Dungeon/LORD**
 
Genre: Power
 
FFO: Theocracy, Blind Guardian, Excellently Cheesy Power Metal
 
Start with: *Resurrection* (1999); LORD: *Ascendence* (2007).
 
MA: https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Dungeon/171; https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Lord/10309
 
In amongst the murky extreme metal, here's something nicer and more palatable aimed at those for whom death/black/thrash isn't really their cup of tea. Dungeon are one of Australia's legendary power metal bands, and LORD are the continuation of the band in everything but name. Lord Tim is the driving force behind the bands and both bands once featured the drumming talent of Tim Yatras (Austere, Nazxul, Autumn's Dawn and millions of other bands). The Dungeon back catalogue is available through the LORD bandcamp page and it's pretty much all worth checking out if you're into power metal. It's even worth a look if you're not really into that IMO.
 
If I liked this Aussie band I might like the following Aussie band(s):
 
**Silent Knigh**t: Some similarly cheesy but catchy power metal from down under. It's worth grabbing the 2017 re-recording/remaster of their debut *The Masterplan* as a starting point.

--
 
**Nazxul**
 
Genre: Black Metal
 
FFO: Emperor, Astriaal
 
MA: https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Nazxul/2912
 
Start with: *Black Seed*  (EP 1998)
 
A weird, obscure black metal band that is apparently a part of some Order of the Black Serpent thing alongside a bunch of other Aussie BM bands? For the length of time that they've been a band, they've got a fairly small collection of material, yet they've got a decent live presence and are often cited as influential. They've got a bit of a revolving door of members, but have featured the likes of Rev. Kriss Hades (Sadistik Exekution) Tim Yatras (tonnes of bands), Steve Hughes (Slaughter Lord, Mortal Sin) and Peter Peric (Dungeon, Rookwood).  Worth looking into if you like Emperor-style black metal.
 
If I liked this Aussie band I might like the following Aussie band(s):
 
**Astriaal**: One of the Brisbane occult bands to be covered in more detail in a later post. 
 
**Austere**: DSBM from Wollongong just south of Sydney (which has a fair Black Metal scene itself). Fairly standard for the style, their two full-lengths are worth looking into.

--
 
**Psycroptic**
 
Genre: Tech Death
 
FFO: Obscura, Decapitated, Necrophagist, Spawn of Possession, Archspire
 
Start with: *Sceptre of the Ancients* (2003)
 
MA: https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Psycroptic/187
 
Oh look, the one notable band from Tasmania! Yay! Tech Death isn't normally my cup of tea, but I quite like these guys, they manage to keep the technicality without getting too wanky and have some solid riffs and melodies in the mix. Former vocalist Chalky's 'croaking' vocal style was also something of a draw card/gimmick for people and it works decently well IMO. Drummer Dave Haley is something of an Aussie legend having been in Damaged, Blood duster and Abramelin, and he and his brother are also in Ruins.
 
If I liked this Aussie band I might like the following Aussie band(s):
 
**Mephistopheles**: Chalky joined this band after his tenure with Spawn of Possession and Psycroptic. Fairly standard tech death, also from Hobart.
 
**Oroborous**: Likewise, somewhat standard tech death, but they seem relatively popular. Not really my thing, so perhaps other commenters can elaborate more on Aussie tech-death?

--
 
**iNFeCTeD**
 
Genre: Industrial Death
 
FFO: Morbid Angel, early Fear Factory, Godflesh
 
Start with: *Crawlspace* (1994)
 
MA: https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Infected/5687
 
A band that was very popular for a brief time but never quite ‚Äòmade it‚Äô, in part due to difficulties touring widely from their home base of Perth. Their albums are something of a product of their time but manage to keep the death metal solid without giving into the industrial/groove/nu-metally side of things like some of the bands in the FFO list did. Still worth looking at, especially if industrial death mixed with bits of grind and doom is your thing. The follow-up *CoNTRoL* (1995) introduces a keyboard and is a bit more gothic.
 
If I liked this Aussie band I might like the following Aussie band(s):
 
I'm a bit stumped here to be honest. This isn't really something I'm into, so perhaps someone in the comments could offer some suggestions?

---
 
**My picks for lesser-known but still solid bands**
-- 
Like the previous section, these bands aren't organised by any particular genre or scene, but are a collection of some of our smaller and/or up-and-coming bands that I wanted to feature briefly here. Many of these are fairly new bands, and are very much worth checking out!

--
 
**Cauldron Black Ram** 

Genre: Black/Death 
 
FFO: early Samael, Innsmouth, Sacriphyx, Ares Kingdom
 
Start with: *Skulduggery* (2004)
 
MA: https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Cauldron_Black_Ram/14440
 
Next time somebody tells you that Alestorm are 'Pirate Metal' and that lyrics are a good basis for determining genre, play some of this for them and then tell them BuT tHeY sInG aBoUt PiRaTeS???? On a more serious note they write some EXCELLENT riffs and aren't afraid to use them.

--
 
**Contaminated**
 
Genre: Death
 
FFO: Tomb Mold, murky caverns
 
Start with: *Final Man* (2017)
 
MA: https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Contaminated/3540378961
 
Contaminated featured fairly prominently in last year's Album of the Year series and with good reason. Filthy, crushing death metal riffs and a solid live presence paired with it. Well worth your time if you enjoy murky death metal at all.
 
--

**Golgothan Remains**
 
Genre: Death
 
FFO: Tomb Mold, Incantation, Suffering Hour
 
Start with: *Perverse Offerings to the Void* (2018)
 
MA: https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Golgothan_Remains/3540411725
 
A current shreddit darling, again with good reason. Their album this year is fantastic, and for me was only topped by Tomb Mold's recent release (seeing a pattern?). They manage a fair amount of melody in their death metal without compromising on their other elements and have some great songwriting chops to boot.
 
--

**Hordes of the Black Cross**
 
Genre: Black/Thrash
 
FFO: Darkthrone, Inquisition
 
Start with: *Dawn of War, Nights of Chaos* (2015)
 
MA: https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Hordes_of_the_Black_Cross/3540331072
 
Pretty catchy as far as black/thrash goes, less oppressive and dark to my ears. From memory, their entire discography is available fairly cheaply on Bandcamp and is all pretty good, some great riffs across their various releases.

--
 
**Ignivomous**
 
Genre: Death
 
FFO: Immolation, Incantation, Cruciamentum
 
Start with: *Contragenesis* (2012)
 
MA: https://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Ignivomous/Contragenesis/338207
 
Solid, straightforward death metal here. Some nice tremolo style riffs in amongst everything with a nicely murky production topping it off. Chris ""Volcano"" Broadway has also been in many of Australia's significant metal acts (Abominator, Denouncement Pyre, Destr√∂yer 666, Cemetery Urn).

--
 
**Runespell** 

Genre: Viking Metal (as in Bathory, the actual genre meaning)
 
FFO: *Blood Fire Death*-era Bathory
 
Start with: *Unhallowed Blood Oath* (2017)
 
MA: https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Runespell/3540426503
 
Do you like Viking-era Bathory? If yes, you'll like this; if no, might still be worth a listen because it's pretty accessible overall if you find Bathory themselves a bit too much. Nothing super new here, but a one-man black metal project (because those are sooo rare) that does what it does well.

--
 
**The Furor**
 
Genre: Black/Death
 
FFO: Impiety, Destr√∂yer 666
 
Start with: *Cavalries of the Occult* (2017)
 
MA: https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/The_Furor/17151
 
A band that's been around for a while, but I particularly enjoy their more recent output (their earlier material is still solid though). Drummer Louis Rando is in several noteworthy bands (Impiety, Depravity, Bloodlust, Mhorgul, Psychonaut). Fairly catchy and melodic as far as black/thrash goes.

--
 
**Atra Vetosus**
 
Genre: Melodic Black 
 
FFO: Mg≈Ça, Astral Winter, Batushka
 
Start with: *Apricity* (2018)
 
MA: https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Atra_Vetosus/3540337074
 
A recent discovery of mine that I quite like. Fairly calm melodic back with a viking-style choir reminiscent of Bathory's calmer moments and a sense of atmosphere that doesn‚Äôt get lost in itself. Worth looking into if you enjoy melodic/atmospheric black that's not too shoegaze-y.

--- 
 
That's all for this post. I hope this is helpful and interesting to people. Next time I'll cover the historical/musical development of Aussie metal from our pub/hard rock bands through to our thrash metal greats. Happy to take any feedback in the comments, and I'm looking forward to sharing more Aussie metal with people who haven't yet found it!

892,Metallica is playing a Coke Zero-sponsored concert in Antarctica. Really.
893,"Before the automatic downvote, I don't want to say anything about their musical merits or faults, nor their successes or failures. 

As a fan of a broad spectrum of metal, it's easy to notice that the more mainstream bands get a lot of hate. They're not metal enough, not good enough, not complex enough, or simply appeal to an audience that most of us are not a part of. 

However, I feel one thing is overlooked: *These are the bands that help pull kids into metal.*

Few, if any, metal-heads simply begin by liking the bands we grow to like - take, Cannibal Corpse or Meshuggah, for instance. The growls and screams, the distorted guitar, the complex drums, these are things that grow on you, slowly (or sometimes quickly) and over time. 

So, even though bands like Five Finger Death Punch are too radio-friendly and perhaps even musically devoid (and often arrogant), they are certainly good for helping developing metal-heads find their way to the heavier, more intricate bands that we know and love, a stepping stone of sorts.

So, even though we may not like these bands or respect them, it disheartens me to see so much hatred given to the metal*ish* bands that help to spread our beloved genre to a much broader audience, and I suppose I simply want to take a moment to acknowledge these bands for being the entry-level bands they are when it comes to the metal genre(s). These are the bands that mix into the radio lineups of Nickleback and Theory of a Deadman and Limp Biscuit, and these are the bands that help others submerge themselves in metal, the tip of the iceberg, if you will.

904,"A year ago, I started on a project to plough through the Metal Archives in a quest to discover some of the more obscure albums from the golden era of heavy metal. The results were surprising in that more often than not, each week would yield a record that I loved enough to go out and try to find to add to my small collection. I heard some stinkers for sure, but the overall quality of heavy metal in that era was so vastly superior to what it is now that it boggles the mind how many truly great albums were out there that were buried with the passage of time.

This list is not a *Best of the Eighties* by any means, so don't bother replying with, ""How could you skip over my favourite underground band?"" I didn't skip over it; it just never showed up on the radar. Since the selection process was as random as I could reasonably make it, and since the pool of material is as deep as it is wide, it's unlikely that I would actually happen to chance upon your beloved favourites anyway. So here are the posts in order:

Before I give you my best-of picks, you should know a little bit about what I actually like. I like low- to mid-tempo heavy metal. I like it to be bombastic and punchy. I like it when metal bands incorporate elements of rock in their riffs and choruses. So there are times when I just couldn't get behind a particular speedy release and opted for the glammy party album with screamed choruses instead. Sorry. So if you want to get the full effect of my research, read each post and get the full description of each album to determine what you want to hear. Now then, here are my favourites from each week:

* [**Aryon** - ***Rebels of the Night***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sq0v35Spew8) - Very rare and hard to find, but an excellent example of some unique-sounding heavy metal with a party vibe
* [**Blind Vengeance** - ***A Taste of Sin***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpp5xacsCUM) - Another equally rare album, but super catchy and a great listen from beginning to end.
* [**Crossbones** - ***Crossbones***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOYjAcLWedA) - Killer Italian heavy metal that is somewhat reminscient of KISS.
* [**Dr√Ωsill** - ***Welcome to the Show***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J_Wxs3EoFk) - Fantastic Maiden worship from Iceland.
* [**Emerald** - ***Down Town***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oq7ug0TLpGQ) - Superb Dutch heavy metal with an absolutely maniacal screamer on vocals.
* [**Frozen Eyes** - ***Frozen Eyes***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBKgyl0lI3I) - Swedish heavy metal that is as weird as it is fun. Not to be taken seriously, but original enough to warrant some attention.
* [**Goliath** - ***Goliath***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFux-HFAAR0) - Epic, rip-roaring Spanish metal infused with Priest and presented with the whole eighties package, ballad and all.
* [**Hallowed** - ***Hallowed***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85HA2WtJYI) - Unique and original, but unmistakably true to real heavy metal.
* [**III Kanal** - ***Kanal III***](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA5D53F360AF4DD6C) - Unbelievably solid hard rock/heavy metal from Croatia from the very early years in the Yugo metal scene. Catchy from beginning to end.
* [**Jackpot** - ***Full House***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhNCtHAC92k) - German heavy metal that borrows musically and vocally from Priest. Not the most consistent, but its high spots are fantastic.
* [**Karisma** - ***Sweet Revenge***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHzAwSB0mI0) - Very early Brazilian heavy metal. It's low-fi and raw but chock full of character.
* [**Lazy** - ***Creature***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yGQ2vzn7cg) - Slow, punchy, and catchy through and through, this is a shining example of Swedish traditional metal.
* [**Malteze** - ***Count Your Blessings***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P04QLnL1pDk) - A lesser-known female-fronted band with fiery and speedy riffs that consistently delivers all the way through.
* [**Norden Light** - ***Shadows from the Wilderness***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5LsJA9TBPs) - Super melodic Swedish metal that relies heavy on the synths, but still manages to deliver a powerful punch.
* [**Osmi Putnik** - ***Uliƒçna molitva***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nP0NOQWTYh8) - Yet another fantastic Croatian band that specialises in melodic choruses and crunchy riffs and innovative bass lines.
* [**Pomaranƒça** - ***Peklenska Pomaranƒça***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix33RkHi_Y4) - Oh right, here's *another* Yugo metal band. This is the earliest of the Slovenian metal bands and is every bit as infectious as the best from the early scene.
* [**T.T. Quick** - ***Medal of Honor***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b2ANv-0__Q) - Great American heavy metal that borrows heavily from Metal Church, but a little less rough around the edges. Lovers of guitar heroics are encouraged to check this one out.
* [**Razormaid** - ***First Cutt***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSlES9moFo) - Glam/party heavy metal taken to its ultimate extreme. Yes, I love every bit of this album. *Every last bit.*
* [**Sadwings** - ***Lonely Hero***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcNCjReDxMU) - More Swedish trad that shows the rest of Europe exactly how to use keyboards in a heavy metal album and still keep it good. Simple overall, but unbelievably powerful in its execution.
* [**Thruster** - ***M.I.A.***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WdLWcXwK1c) - An aggressively fast and fiery album with scorching riffs and unapologetically over-the-top lead work, there isn't a track on here that will disappoint.
* [**U4EA** - ***A Power Greater than Ourselves***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLXVbg56V0) - An accessible, slow album, perhaps a bit plain, but not bad; there is a rare character to this album that I don't find elsewhere.
* [**Vandale** - ***Schandale***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFZEn8jIcJc) - Dutch hard rock/heavy metal with tons of killer songs and hooks. Possibly the catchiest closer of any album I have ever heard.
* [**Warning** - ***Warning***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wis_1nPaWO0) - Unbelievably solid French heavy metal that is equal parts gritty and melodic with an overall fatness to the sound that just makes me want to shake my fist and watch things explode from a safe distance.
* [**Xipe** - ***Fly of Phoenix***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI40qwji1gc) - Very unique Italian album with a *very* strong resemblance to Adramelch's incredible debut. It's not the most consistent in its sound, but its high points are out of this world. Impossible to find.
* [**Yngwie Malmsteen** - ***Trilogy***](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8a8cutYP7fouB-eySannboIQdETmXCZm) - Obscure Swedish virtuoso guitarist who single-handedly paved the way for generations of guitarists for decades to come. Because this album has zero flaws, it is automatically the greatest heavy metal album ever made.
* [**Zeus** - ***Zeus V***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHBTJ3n8Tqk) - Killer Spanish metal with thundering riffs and soaring vocals, and ultra-over-the-top Van Halenesque solos. Don't bother trying to buy it unless you just want to pay your rent late this month.

Here's the deal though - the ones I listed above aren't exactly representative of the best, and I say that because some weeks, the offerings were bad, and other weeks, the offerings were so good that I had to pick a single winner amidst two (2) or even three (3) really strong albums. Here are some of the ones that flew in under the radar:

* [**Allied Forces** - ***The Day After***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikV3gPkfBaA)
* [**Blitzkrieg** - ***Ready for Action***](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkR4YEQi5l2jM67awC9Qj71kcmHRuRMPy)
* [**Dagger** - ***Not Afraid of the Night***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWqSKh76F4)
* [**Dr Skull** - ***Wory Zover***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfOZUYraWy0)
* [**Elixir** - ***The Son of Odin***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czo86DXS24k)
* [**Gunnar Grapsi Grupp** - ***P√µlemine***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uOnetkB-lM)
* [**Greifenhagen** - ***Only For the Night***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQeOvm1EmR0)
* [**Ironcross** - ***Bloodhounds***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA_6PhP9HEs)
* [**Lord** - ***Big City Lights***](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRfaLgR31XghCb5GVu9ZJ01NLiHdtYbzB)
* [**Lynx** - ***Caught in the Trap***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BssxLX-p88Y)
* [**Mainiax** - ***Boys Night Out***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSAsI7OTJf8&amp;list=PLH-Ln8A7VhpMja4GIu4dbbYA06z4nWMy7)
* [**Oz** - ***Fire in the Brain***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA_7VCnY1f4)
* [**Ponce Pilate** - ***Les Enfants du Cimeti√®re***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3LPPLVPr-8)
* [**Xalt** - ***Dark War***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLwZ07EdalU)
* [**X-Caliber** - ***Warriors of the Night***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8MjKiiaquU)
* [**Zion** - ***Thunder From the Mountain***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itBOFj3vwN0)

And finally, here are what I believe to be the all-around best ten (10) heavy metal releases from this project *regardless of your tastes in heavy metal*:

* Blind Vengeance
* Dr√Ωsill
* Emerald
* Elixir
* Ironcross
* Lazy
* Malteze
* Sadwings
* Warning
* Xipe

Finally, here are the ones I was able to track down and add to my collection:

* Blitzkreig
* Dagger
* III Kanal
* Inox
* Lazy
* Osmi Putnik
* Pomaranƒça
* T.T. Quick
* Warning
* Vandale

Hope you enjoyed this, and happy hunting!"

924,"Most people know Thin Lizzy from their commercial [hit single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quyB8PMTD3o). But I think a lot of newcomers to Metal overlook how influential this innovative band was for the genre (remember, one of their albums is listed in the [Subgenre Essentials](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/wiki/metalsubgenres)). It certainly took me a while to appreciate this band, so hopefully this post will inspire newcomers to dive in and pay their respects. 
 
To commemorate the death of the charismatic bassist, lyricist, and frontman of Thin Lizzy - [Phil Lynott](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Phil_Lynott_Statue_at_Bruxelles_Dublin.jpg) - listen to how heavy, metallic, and plain bad-ass this band could get back in the day. This is not intended as a ""guide to Thin Lizzy"" sort of post, just my tribute to the wonderful legacy of this man. 


**1974** 

[Sha-La-La](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL9U7yIbyk) - One of the many instances where we hear the big influence Jimmi Hendrix had on Lynott.  

Also check out this [crushing live version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyvvC_tgsWY). I think in general, Lizzy was a great live act. Their album Live and Dangerous stands up there with No Sleep 'Til Hammersmith and Unleashed in the East. 

**1975**

[Ballad of a Hard Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kqYpBB7NmU) 

**1976**

[Emerald](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Qp9wPvcJwM) - Does this Slough Feg song [sound familiar?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThSna4T3xc8)

[Johnny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-tjCf7Cmyw) - Those horns... These guys had an eclectic source of influences. 


**1977**

[Opium Trail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8n5RYRpXgFA) - Pure, unadultered Heavy Metal. Only Judas Priest's twin guitar attack could rival this back in the 70s.

**1979**

[R√≥is√≠n Dubh (Black Rose): A Rock Legend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjjpBb9q1PA) - Epic, moving, beautiful. I have no connection to Ireland whatsoever. I've never been there. Not planning on going anytime soon, but this song makes me want to. This is Lynott's love song for the land he called home. 

**1981**

[Angel of Death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxjRpr0xW0U) - Interesting lyrics coming from a Christian. 

**1983**

Revitalized with new guitarist John Sykes in the band, it [HITS YOU, LIKE A HAMMER, GODDAMN!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTNzuBh6zTg) Kind of like what Ritchie Faulkner did for Judas Priest with Redeemer of Souls, Sykes did that to Thin Lizzy in '83. 

[Cold Sweat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-IMZ7gCAGE) - How many bands have covered this goddamn song? 


------------------------------

If you're still not convinced about the influence this band had over Metal, listen to what giants such as [Running Wild,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW6FMfpaOXc) [Iron Maiden,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqasEnIZxXU) [Heathen,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_22XA3lRDqw) [Sodom,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTOFa1y1B9g), [Armored Saint,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQEjj88ARk4) [Metallica*,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boanuwUMNNQ) [Megadeth,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FZ7bCnpa48) [Anthrax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3wHBW0GdI), [Helloween](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oNVFsKm690) and [Mastodon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wfkjecg0pRY) have to say about it. Furthermore, Lynott left his unexpected mark with the Swedish Heavy Load by playing bass as a guest on [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uc4Hz4WXD6M). And that distincitive sound on Motorhead's underrated [Another Perfect Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFZhfysKcyg&amp;list=PLSD7oAnX5glmBs7i-FECtnf9zFxyi-UrE) is courtesy of another Lizzy member, guitarrist Brian Robertson. 

On a final note, Scott Gorham's band [Black Star Riders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq6Z6C3ipMk) is continuing the spirit of Lizzy to this day. Additionally, recent bands such as Black Trip and Valkyrie are very open about their big Lizzy influence. Of all these acts, my favorite by far is an underground, wonderful Virginian band by the name of...


[CORSAIR](https://corsair.bandcamp.com/album/corsair-s-t) 

Everything this band has released slays. 

-----------------------------

*Whiskey in the Jar is a traditional folk song, but this is basically Metallica covering Thin Lizzy's version. And what the fuck does that video have to do with the song... I don't know.

956,"Greetings. As we have done in the past, the eve before the Top X vote is devoted to martialish law for the subreddit in what people want to see. While not entirely democratic, the [Banned &amp; Restricted Discussions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/7308rz/shreddits_official_banned_restricted_discussion/) provide active users a chance to moderate what is seen on the sub. With that said, any grievance or addition can be brought up at those quarterly discussions.  The mods then take these discussions and decide among themselves what gets banned, restricted, and jokingly blacklisted for a whole year. 

---------

#Keywords:

* **Banned:** No Songs Posted By The Band Except for New Releases Within 2 weeks of Release Date. 

* **Restricted:** Most Popular Songs from Band are Banned. Deeper Cuts Are Allowed Plus New Releases.  

* **Armor Class**: Your Armor Class (AC) represents how hard it is for opponents to land a solid, damaging blow on you. It‚Äôs the attack roll result that an opponent needs to achieve to hit you. Your AC is equal to the following: 10 + armor bonus + shield bonus + Dexterity modifier + size modifier. 

------------

#Carcass is Banned

Carcass was added on the restricted list this summer and since then has continued to be posted to popularity with few discussions all looking like the comments on a porn video. At this point, the band's name is the darlings of the grindcore community and as the melodic death fans as well as any legacy magazine who needs a #1 album of the year. 

#Anthrax is Restricted

We want to see more banned bands become restrcited since well known bands have deeper catelogs that could do well on the sub and provide interest to even the most elitist asshole. Anthrax is a band with a long catalog that is known for about 20 songs. Thus these songs by Anthrax are banned with the rest of their catalog open with urges for responsible drinking. You guys did good with Dio, lets not get crazy. 

Anthrax Songs Banned: 

* Madhouse	
* Caught in a Mosh
* I Am the Law	
* Indians	
* Got The Time	
* Among the Living	
* Antisocial	
* Metal Thrashing Mad	
* A.I.R.	
* Deathrider
* Bring The Noise (Or any Public Enemy Collaborations)
* A Skeleton in the Closet
* Safe Home
* Armed and Dangerous
* Belly Of The Beast
* Medusa	
* Keep It In The Family	
* Lone Justice
* One World
* Only	

#Watchlist 

These are the bands that we are keeping an eye on that were brough up this and last discussion. We want to keep your wishes in mind when doing these announcements and while we may not be able to band every band you hate, we can give you rubber band gun and a wooden star to go arrest wrong doers.

* Inquisition 
* Down
* Cannibal Corpse 

There was also a motion to have Thursday be Lord of the Rings Summoning Day. We are taking that under consideration. Any sort of grevance, please leave here. No Magic jokes this time.

Down-voting is ineffective in stopping this type of content, due to a simple matter of time. It takes a second to view and upvote an image meme, whereas 4 minutes or more need to be spent on a song.

982,"Hey everyone. I just got back from seeing Obituary (which was awesome!!!) and I feel like I need to let out a little rant. I'm a pretty big guy, pushing 6'5 and 230 pounds, I'm the kind of guy you'd expect to be tearing up a moshpit at every show. The trouble is, I don't like to mosh, in fact I dislike it, I'd rather be watching the musicians perform and just headbanging.

I like to stand in between the stage and the pit because that's the best place to stand at my local venue, I realize I'm a better door than a window so I usually stand at the back of the throngs of people in front of the stage, and I usually have my back turned to the pit. Every fucking show some douchebag will punch me, or try to grab and pull me into the pit, and some people have straight up done a running headbutt into my back trying to get me into the pit. There's nothing more irritating than being bodyslammed repeatedly by some drunken shitbag while trying to enjoy a concert.

If you mosh at concerts, please realize that there are some people out there who don't want to mosh, don't be that guy who kicks and punches people in the crowd, those people are the worst kind of people ever

Sorry for my long rant, I'm tired and I should be going to bed... Obituary ruled though! \m/

986,"Greetings my fellow blasphemers.

Having taken existing documentaries about Black Metal into consideration, the part of Black Metal history that is mainly covered is the story of Mayhem. Stories of other bands that are related to the thematics of Black Metal are rarely covered, as well as other subgenres and their history.

What I am trying is to make a documentary about Black Metal which will include every part of Black Metal history, every genre, and controversial stories of the bands that are part of the scene. Starting with Venom and going into the First\-Wave (Hellhammer, Celtic Frost, Sodom, Bathory, Sarcofago, Tormentor, etc.) defining musical characteristics of the First\-Wave, and their ideologies, War Metal begginings (Blasphemy, Beherit, Archgoat, etc.) and the stories of several controversial bands, firstly Blasphemy, defining musical characteristics of War Metal, and their ideologies, Second\-Wave (Darkthrone, Burzum, Mayhem, etc.), towards the ""new wave"" (DSBM, Blackgaze, etc.) and the Viking/Pagan scene.

Main goal is to introduce new people to the genre, define subgenres and their musical characteristics, tell stories that are important part of Black Metal, and speak about the ideologies or religions that have been foundations for Black Metal.

Which part of the genre you think needs more coverage or recognition? What stories are not/rarely told? Generaly, what would you want to see in a documentary.

Looking forward to hear your suggestions and opinions.

Thank you in advance."

Happy Anniversary, Rush!

Oh, and it's Geddy Lee's birthday to-day as well.

I know people have mixed feelings about Rush here, especially since their status as a metal band is often debated. But I think we can all agree that their influence on metal was unmistakable, and the lyrical themes they explored are still beloved by metal listeners after all these years. And they played some [heavy riffs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW72Gmqjse4) as well.

1096,"Disclaimer:
I'm not a native english speaker, so please excuse any mistakes regarding language. But feel free to point them out so I can learn.

Story:
A few years ago, I still had to attend school. If that alone wasn't bad enough, I had to learn english. And our teacher was, let's put it mildly, strange sometimes. He almost never spoke english in class, resulting in us not learning very much to say the least. But, because it was an english class, we had to write our exams in english. Surprise. His exam questions were either easy or confusing. Long story short, one of the questions in our last exam was of the latter kind.

Terrorism was a big thread around 2006, well it still is of course, but a few years ago it seemed to be rising fast and everyone was talking about it. So my teacher thought he should deal with this topic in our last exam.

Another topic my mind revolved around for a long time was Slayer's album ""Christ Illusion"". Because I love it. And since it was released in 2006, it happened that the last english exam and me listening to Christ Illusion took place at the same time.

If you are still reading this poorly written story, I will now answer your most important question: What the heck was the exam question?
It said: ""Imagine you are a terrorist, and you want to threaten your enemies with a message. What would you say?"" (Did I mention that he was a strange person sometimes?)

Well at first I was completely out of ideas and could only think of the stuff you see on TV sometimes. But then I could literally hear it inside my head - Slayer. Track 5 on the great album Christ Illusion is called ""Jihad"", and it contains a short hate speech at the end. Since I was already listening to it for a few days in ""repeat"" mode, I was able to think of most of this speech and write it down.

Conclusion: Teacher was very impressed, even read it out loud in class (which was seriously disturbing btw) and I was just happy that I listen to metal. Teach this to your children: Metal can literally save you sometimes in school!

tl;dr: Strange english teacher, assigned us with the task to write a hate speech in an exam, I wrote the ending of ""Jihad"" by Slayer, teacher was impressed.

The mod team is still talking about things. Some of us worked with Victoria in other subs, some of us have literally zero idea what is going on. This whole news also came at a really weird time when some of us are sleeping only to be awoken to fire.  Whatever the case and whatever the outcome, we will be sure to inform you all of any great sweeping changes. For now try not post any Sabaton. 

**Update:** At this moment /r/metal is operating as normal except for specific watch on Sabaton videos. Talks seem to be in order with admins and default mods so any blackout now would be a match lit in a forest fire. I promise you that if anything looks dire, the mods would lift all restrictions before this sub went down. If you ever see a picture of Dio on the front page that is the Seventh Seal. 

**Reminder** Any sort of content removal during this time is treated the same as any other time and any shitpost being nuked has nothing to do with censorship rather the mods just slapping you upside the head and telling you to stop being an idiot. If you have a problem with this stick around a few days and bring it up during the general or metal discussion threads.

1129,"This is a primer focusing on thrash metal bands from the 1980s and 1990s (mainly the late '80s to early '90s, when there was a huge surge of thrash metal bands) that had the potential to make it big, but never really were able to break into the ""mainstream"" (with a couple exceptions).  These bands range from power/thrash like Laaz Rockit, to death/thrash like Sadus, to prog/technical thrash like Watchtower or Coroner.  If you feel that a band should be added to this list, then feel free to suggest it. 

- **Abomination (US)** - [Tragedy Strikes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzNO92VheNk), [The Final War (EP)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdW-EymKWc)

Abomination, a Chicagoan death/thrash band - not to be confused with, say, the New York black metal band or the Missouri thrashcore band - released these two albums 8 years apart, but lose no quality in between, which is certainly a rare feat.  The production is raw and dirty, and Paul Speckmann's bass and vocal work is astounding - at some points, the bass is even louder than the guitars.

- **The Accused** - [The Return of... Martha Splatterhead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wym-w3FmXtU), [More Fun than an Open Casket Funeral!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSmSa7f_fU4), [Martha Splatterhead's Maddest Stories Ever Told](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7QV_e8borI), [Grinning Like an Undertaker](https://open.spotify.com/album/53ZeGTgIGbx0d9MmgciuGO)

Seattle crossover band The Accused is one of the lesser known crossover groups on this list, when compared to, say, S.O.D. or D.R.I., but differ no less in quality.  ""Fart"" spits and barks out the violence-obsessed, humorous lyrics with a passionate anger; Chewy (played from 1981-86) and Maggot Brain's (played from 1986-93) bass lines are meaty and ferocious; the riffs are intense and wicked fast, while still maintaining a certain groove to them.

- **Agent Steel** - [Skeptics Apocalypse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7F0eNKIc1iY), [Mad Locust Rising (EP)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Ti7T-OqKQ), [Unstoppable Force](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvUHflq72cE)

One of several bands on this list that hail from the Los Angeles region, Agent Steel combine blazing fast speed/thrash riffs and drums with the triumphant vocal style and personality of power metal to create a phenomenal and unique style (this is best shown in these 3 albums).  They are somewhat in the vein of Exciter (speed metal), Helstar (power/speed), and Metal Church (power/heavy/thrash).

- **Anacrusis** - [Suffering Hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3nMaKUrxDY), [Manic Impressions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJB-lFlmJ4), [Screams and Whispers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcg9x3DXe0U) 

A neat thrash band from St. Louis, Missouri.  Suffering Hour is more strictly thrash than the other two albums; Manic Impressions and Screams and Whispers are progressive thrash albums, similar to some of Voivod's work.

- **Annihilator** - [Alice in Hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDDLF98PTUk), [Never Neverland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9-HDkxO1Bk) 


One of the more popular bands on this list, Annihilator comes out of Canada and is probably the most successful Canadian thrash band.  Both these albums are extremely technical speed/thrash albums, driven by the intricate guitar work of founding member, Jeff Waters.

- **A.R.G.** - [Entrance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-cxw-7NHbM), [One World Without the End](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9qJh95fq5k)

These two albums from Finnish thrash band A.R.G. (which stands for Ancient Rotten Graveguards) are hard-hitting and dark, with pulverizing riffs and raw production.  These albums have an almost Kreator-esque feel to them in terms of the production and riffage.

- **Artillery** - [Fear of Tomorrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNdy0gL4kU4), [Terror Squad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEg0Dinrfq4), [By Inheritance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msxbcwSucF0)

An awesome Danish thrash band.  These 3 albums are incredibly fast and technical with blazing drums and complex riffs.  These albums are similar to some of Heathen or Megadeth's work.

- **–ê—Å–ø–∏–¥** - [–ö—Ä–æ–≤–æ–∏–∑–ª–∏—è–Ω–∏–µ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlitksyuOd8)

Hailing from Russia, –ê—Å–ø–∏–¥ - which translates to ""Aspid"" - released this masterpiece of progressive/technical thrash metal in 1993, relatively late into the big boom of thrash bands.  They sound similar to Coroner or Watchtower; they also sound, essentially, like the prototype for modern prog/tech thrash bands like Vektor.

- **Assassin** - [The Upcoming Terror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4E-AJLjUwBA)

A Teutonic thrash band, they never really got the same spotlight as, say, Kreator or Sodom, though they deserved it.  This is a very aggressive record, with very raw production and punishing riffs.  It reminds me of Destruction, another, more popular Teutonic thrash band.

- **Atrophy** - [Socialized Hate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4E-AJLjUwBA)

Released in 1988 from Arizona thrash band Atrophy, Socialized Hate is similar to records from Vio-Lence and Sacred Reich.  This album has blistering leads, rapid riffing, and powerful production; all in all, Atrophy is probably one of the most underrated '80s thrash bands.

- **Blessed Death** - [Destined for Extinction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h8tbQb3Q_8)

After the generic and forgettable album Kill or Be Killed, New Jersey speed/thrash band put out a solid and concise record two years later called Destined for Extinction.  This album is raw and dirty, in terms of both production and riffing, and Larry Portelli's vocals go from gruff grunting to high-pitched wailing similar to the vocal style used by Tom Araya in Slayer's early albums, or even somewhat like Bruce Dickinson's high notes.

- **Carnivore** - [s/t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnwF5Jsjouc), [Retaliation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86i_r_pgkvw)

Coming from New York is thrash/speed/crossover band Carnivore.  These two records, released 2 years apart, are incredibly unique in their genre, sounding like a crossover band with some Type O Negative and Mot√∂rhead influences.  Fronted by late vocalist/bassist ""Lord Petrus"" Steele, this is an overlooked band that deserves more attention than it got.

- **Coroner** - [R.I.P.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R36wU7kzo3M), [Punishment for Decadence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOdg43J5r1w), [No More Color](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vckfZBVxByA), [Mental Vortex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3dAavsgnVg)

Possibly one of the most underrated bands in all of thrash is Swiss progressive/technical thrash band Coroner.  All 4 of these albums are packed with dense and intricate riffs, stunning lead work, technical drums, and complex bass lines.  Even though their final studio album, Grin, isn't on this list, every single thing they've put out is high-quality, boundaries-pushing prog thrash.

- **Corrosion of Conformity** - [Blind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipVobLKDkBQ)

After their thrashcore/hardcore punk phase and before their sludge/Southern metal period, North Carolina band Corrosion of Conformity dropped a little record in the vein of crossover thrash called Blind.  Featuring grimy production, catchy and memorable yet heavy riffs and drums, and powerful vocals, this is a tour de force of dirty crossover.

- **Cro-Mags** - [The Age of Quarrel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkITlCa-r6k), [Best Wishes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikSTLuFaZz4)

One of many bands out of the 1980's New York hardcore/crossover movement, Cro-Mags play a violent and raw form of thrash, more ""extreme,"" if you will, than their New York counterparts at the time (such as S.O.D., though they are pretty violent in their own right).  John Joseph Bloodclot's vocals are throat-shredding at points, going from violent barks to fierce growls; the drums, riffs, and bass lines are insanely fast and intense.

- **Crumbsuckers** - [Life of Dreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pu4BPfyJ5c)

Long Island-based crossover band Crumbsuckers is one of many to come from the '80s New York hardcore/crossover movement, similar to Cro-Mags and S.O.D.  Ironically enough, they sound more like the L.A. crossover band D.R.I. - who are mentioned below - with nasty vocals and even nastier production and riffs.

- **Cryptic Slaughter** - [Convicted](https://open.spotify.com/album/7mHgdfVzpEFJ3w5ZMM1Ehv), [Money Talks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3rPC1j4rhiaKGaqmNp8FzhNazXKeKMGn)

Hailing from Santa Monica, California, Cryptic Slaughter is one of the fastest and most raw crossover thrash bands out there.  The drums are punishing, the guitars and bass are blazingly fast, and vocalist Bill Crooks screams and shouts like there's no tomorrow.  If you're looking for brutal and raw crossover thrash, look no further than Convicted and Money Talks.

- **Cyclone** - [Brutal Destruction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUHhntV03pc)

Belgian thrashers Cyclone - not to be confused with the Japanese prog metal band of the same name - put out some quality thrash with their 1986 album, Brutal Destruction.  Featuring raw vocals that range from a melodic wail to a harrowing shriek, dense guitar and bass riffing, and pounding drums, this is not an album for the faint of heart.

- **Cyclone Temple** - [I Hate Therefore I Am](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRTdbY6LBZY)

Chicago band Cyclone Temple formed out of the ashes of Znowhite - though vocalist Debbie Gunn went on to Sentinel Beast instead of going with the other 3 band members - and created this criminally underrated thrash masterpiece.  The lyrics bemoan the injustices and hardships of the world, sung with melodic yet aggressive passion; the riffing and bass work are some of the most inventive seen out of thrash, accompanied by ripping soloing from Greg Fulton and absolutely massive drumming.

- **Dark Angel** - [Darkness Descends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18lPKkOaU40), [Leave Scars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhYXVfaOkf0), [Time Does Not Heal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGIDb59myO4)

Californian thrash band Dark Angel is known as the ""L.A. Caffeine Machine"" for a reason.  These 3 albums - along with their debut, which is not included on here - are extremely fast, with uncomprising riffs, virtuosic drums from Mr. Gene Hoglan himself, and intricate bass.  Time Does Not Heal even goes into prog thrash territory, as the songs are long with unconventional song structures and odd time signatures.

- **Darkness** - [Death Squad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDpYpBNecpQ)

Though not as popular as their fellow Teutonic thrashers Kreator, Sodom, and Destruction, German thrash group Darkness' 1987 debut album, Death Squad, is of the same quality of those bands' finest records.  They draw more similarities to lesser known German thrash bands Deathrow and Necronomicon - both of whom are on this list - with aggressive, raw production and riffs and pounding drums.

- **DBC** - [s/t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p4_bHa4J2A), [Universe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iCQV3yJ2yE)

Canadian thrash/speed metal band DBC (or Dead Brain Cells) may be one of Canada's most overlooked thrash bands.  Their self-titled and sophomore effort, Universe - which were released 2 years apart - are relentlessly fast and heavy.  Their lyrical content revolves around science, something not touched upon by most bands on this list (except for the proggier ones out of the group).  The riffs are tasteful yet brutal, and the production is surprisingly punchy.  They sadly were overlooked in the huge surge of thrash bands that came around during the same time.

- **Dead Horse** - [Horsecore: An Unrelated Story That's Time Consuming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhBBJRNr3xw), [Peaceful Death and Pretty Flowers](https://open.spotify.com/album/5EJuByKoVge4E1uuvVa4cE)

This band from Houston, Texas combines aggressive and heavy thrash riffs with the speed and intensity of crossover and even some death metal influence for good measure.  All of these influences combine into a very interesting and fantastic approach to thrash that shows in these two phenomenal albums.

- **Death Angel** - [The Ultra-Violence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t48ov0BvkX8)

One of many thrash bands to come out of the Bay Area - and probably one of the most successful, besides Metallica, Megadeth, Exodus, etc. - Death Angel's insane debut effort, The Ultra-Violence, was written when all of its members were under the age of 20 - the drummer, Andy Galeon, was just *14 years old.*  This record is filled to the brim with shredding solos, massive riffs, and impossibly fast drums from a kid who was in his early teens.

- **Deathrow** - [Deception Ignored](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHkEax1vkuU)

Deathrow, hailing from Germany, released Deception Ignored in 1988.  It is a departure from their previous style - in a good way - going from relatively standard speed/thrash to an extremely intricate and fast-paced technical thrash style similar to Coroner or Watchtower from the same era.  Featuring lengthy songs with odd song structures, virtuosic solos, and rapid drumming, it is truly a masterpiece of tech thrash.

- **Defiance** - [Void Terra Firma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_ZZJZe921w)

- **Demolition Hammer** - [Tortured Existence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFN9x6yE-iw), [Epidemic of Violence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZhux8pHjkM)

Demolition Hammer is another seminal part of the East Coast thrash scene in the '80s, though Tortured Existence and Epidemic of Violence are very different kinds of thrash than, say, Anthrax's Among the Living or Overkill's The Years of Decay.  These two records are filthy, heavy, and harsh - their lyrical content is gruesome and violent, with song titles like "".44 Caliber Brain Surgery"" and ""Skull Fracturing Violence.""  Though they shifted towards groove metal in their later years, these two albums are nasty showcases of pure, dirty thrash.

- **D√©tente** - [Recognize No Authority](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd6V1g8VmJw)

Los Angeles thrash/speed band D√©tente's debut, Recognize No Authority, came out in a pivotal year for thrash metal, 1986.  It may not have been the most popular, but it is certainly unique.  They sound very similar to Holy Moses, as they are both thrash/speed bands and they both have relatively harsh female vocals.

- **Devastation (TX)** - [Signs of Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RiOwqY5qTg), [Idolatry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3xgNWH4Owk)

Devastation, a band hailing from Corpus Christi, Texas, is one of the fastest and most aggressive thrash bands on this list.  They are as speedy as Dark Angel, as filthy and raw as Demolition Hammer and Sadus, and as aggressive as Morbid Saint - though they haven't received as much attention as they likely should have, there is no question that they are as fast and as dirty as it gets.

- **D.R.I.** - [Dealing With It!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Jhof6EI8g), [Crossover](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6624AADAE33856D1), [4 of a Kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzY2D0M3XJc), [Thrash Zone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNMEbaQtMR8)

Texas' D.R.I. (a.k.a. Dirty Rotten Imbeciles) are probably one of the most influential crossover thrash bands ever, along with S.O.D. and Suicidal Tendencies.  With these four albums, they perfected the art of fusing thrash metal and hardcore punk together into one fast and rebellious package.  Fun fact: the term ""crossover thrash"" came from the name of their 1987 album, Crossover.

- **Dr. Know** - [This Island Earth](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhNsg7uqmOhrEOmnKFsogLrCI_3UDyfCX), [Wreckage of Flesh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv27A9kDK2c)

- **Epidemic (US)** - [The Truth of What Will Be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG3cTPtMV78)

- **Energetic Krusher** - [Path to Oblivion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW9KbW7uMrQ)

Newcastle's Energetic Krusher might just have one of the filthiest and grimiest albums on this list.  The production is dirty and raw, and the riffs and drums are hard-hitting and fast; this album has a large variety of influences, mixing thrash with crossover, death metal, and even crust punk into one brutal package.

- **Evildead** - [Annihilation of Civilization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQipbcC-Mk)

What can I say?  Los Angeles thrash band Evildead did wonders with their debut LP, Annihilation to Civilization.  The riffs are unique and refreshing while remaining fast and crunchy; the vocalist barks out the apocalyptic lyrics in a heavy and serious fashion; and the soloing and lead work on this is simply phenomenal.  It's just under 40 minutes, but is better than many other lengthier records.

- **Exhorder** - [Slaughter in the Vatican](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pF8S_ssMmI)

Many know New Orleans thrash band as the godfathers of ""groove metal"" (think Pantera from 1990-forward), but this is much more in terms of general sound and production than actual composition.  Kyle Thomas' vocals do sound somewhat Phil Anselmo-esque at points, but Slaughter in the Vatican sounds far more early Slayer and hardcore punk-oriented than groove-oriented.

- **Exumer** - [Possessed by Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rmr9t4z2ZgY)

Exumer's Possessed by Fire is one of the biggest albums released from a German thrash band outside of the ""Unholy Trinity"" of Teutonic thrash (Kreator, Sodom, Destruction).  Mem von Stein's vocals are fucking insane on this record - he barks and practically screams his way through the evil lyrics on these songs.  The riffs are aggressive and the production is raw and brutal, characteristic of Teutonic thrash at this time.

- **Flotsam and Jetsam** - [Doomsday for the Deceiver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsHpfL4Ejxc), [No Place for Disgrace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IlqL-NHPqM)
