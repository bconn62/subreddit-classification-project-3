32,"*Disclaimer: Hey so I wasn't planning on writing one of these for Worlds Apart but a lot of people requested it so I guess here's a big wall of text. Sorry it took so long and sorry for how longwinded this came out. I would also like to warn you guys that I do kind of ramble about some personal stuff during this, which I wouldn't usually do but I figured it worked in the spirit of the record. You can probably grasp the main jist of the thing by just reading the TL;DR at the bottom. But anyway here goes:*
 
As some of you may know with all of Make Them Suffer's albums thus far, there's been a story told through the lyrics of each record. These stories aren't really for everyone, just for those who may be wanting something a little extra from our music. This is the explanation for Worlds Apart. 
  
*SCROLL DOWN NOW FOR THE TL;DR*
  
I want to begin by saying that I've never once intentionally set out to write a story. Each album seems to have a ""sound"", which I then would pair with a lyrical ""theme"", but never once have I ""tried"" to create a narrative. In all honesty, the only thing I ever really think about when writing lyrics are hooks, vocal phrasing and rhymes. Therefor, these stories are always a product of my subconscious and seem to unfold as a series of events that parallel my life.
 
It's because of this that I often don't really know what a story is about when it's written, it usually takes me a while to digest it and work out what I was actually trying to say. The one thing I did know from early on with this record however, was that this album was an extremely personal one. It was personal for me and it was intended to be personal for you too, If you don't feel you have that kind of connection with Worlds Apart, then in a sense I/we have failed. 
  
So moving on; if you've listened to the album a few times through, you may have gained some semblance of the narrative that's taking place, or at bare minimum, a ""theme"". Simply put the main theme of this record is ""communication"". 
  
For me, this record was about my inability to communicate with loved ones. It was about my growing sense of isolation as I was continually distanced further from those dearest to me and worst yet, from myself. This is why I opted for alternate track orders (1 story order, 1 song order). While ending the record with Save Yourself doesn't make sense in terms of the story; it was nonetheless a fitting closer for me personally. You see, that track for me is the first time in ages that I was actually able to find and communicate with myself again, no matter how ugly that may have been. I found closure in that.
  
The phone number listed in contact (both voiced by an automated phone message and written as a phone number in the lyric book) is a potential way to order the tracks (1,8,10,3 etc). By ordering the tracks this way, it will create a story. This story is my story, but it's only one of many ways to order these tracks, so please keep that in mind as we continue. I'll expand more on this idea later.
  
1803-642-795 is a sequence of numbers that's intended to replicate a ""wrong"" phone number. ""1800-numbers"" would never usually contain a ""3"" where it's situated. The phone number simply wouldn't exist. So it's fitting then, that track ""3"" actually represents the beginning of our protagonists descent into isolation. This track is the ""spanner in the works"" and our protagonists call to action. After this track he'd continue to lose touch with this world, reality, and himself. 
  
I'm going to now give a brief paragraph about every song and how it fits in. That'll then be followed by a tl;dr of ""simplified"" explanations. 
  
----------------- 
  
1803-642-795 
  
-1. **The First Movement** 
 
""The First Movement"" begins the album on a whimsical note designed to instil the listener with excitement and wonder for what's to come. It is the only song on the record written in the third-person. It tells the story of a music-loving boy who carries with him a record player. Upon hearing the sound of a beautiful female voice in the wind, the boy drops the pin of his record player to the vinyl. Together, the voice of the girl, and the boys record harmonise perfectly to create ""A Beautiful Song"". This is your ""boy meets girl"". It's worth mentioning that this song has a massive head-nod to the song ""Afghamistam"" by Botch for those who picked up on that. 
  
-8. **Midnight Run**
 
From ""Midnight Run"" and pretty much through the rest of the record lyrics are back to first person. A relationship is well established at this point between the boy &amp; girl. The lyrics of the chorus ""Darling I'll  make you proud, I've been working myself down to the bone"" are both sad and ironic. The verse goes on to tell a story of our protagonist standing up his partner at the theater performance of ""Midnight Run"". For selfish reasons, our protagonist is a no-show as he has his own childish ideas of what a ""Midnight Run"" entails. 
  
-10. **Save Yourself**
 
This is arguably the most terrifying song I've ever had to release. I think the scariest thing about it is that it highlights that in any given MTS track, the protagonist and myself are pretty much interchangeable. Anyway not much needs to be said for the track, other than it's the breakup song of the album. I think the lyrics speak for themselves. 
  
*A continuous lyrical theme on this album is about not learning from your mistakes. I think this song highlights that as we see the same guilt displayed by the protagonist as in Let Me In. However while one album finishes with a Requiem (Old Souls), this one ends with Fireworks.*
  
-3. **Grinding Teeth** 
 
After our couple split in Save Yourself, the protagonist begins to head down a self-destructive spiral. disillusioned by the circumstances, Nothing seems real anymore. Our protagonist seems to be ignoring phone calls from a ""teleprompter"". This just represents him refusing to reconnect with reality. The call from the teleprompter is also a call to action of sorts. 
 
-6. **Contact** 

Our protagonist finally accepts his phone call. From this point on the lines between reality and imaginary are blurred, it's becoming more and more surreal. 
 
-4. **Vortex** 
 
Having accepted the phone call, our protagonist is sucked down the phone line until he is finally spat out into an alternate dimension, leaving behind him only ""an empty dial tone"". Vortex represents the cycle of repeated mistakes that we often spend lifetimes trying to fix. It doesn't matter how far you have come or what you have learned, at some point you will have to face yourself in your ugliest state, and start over. Vortex is a reality check.
 
-2. **Uncharted** 
 
Uncharted and Vortex are paired. Uncharted presents an alternate way to viewing the situation of starting again. While in Vortex our protagonist is spat into another dimension ""decrepit and weak""; Uncharted sees him plunged through the clouds, and guided by the stars. Uncharted presents the notion that sometimes you have to lose yourself, in order to find yourself, and that often the pain and heartaches we've received along the way actually help to improve us. ""Sometimes it's the scars on our hearts that guide us."" Vortex and Uncharted essentially tell the same story of arriving in an alternate dimension, just offer different perspectives of viewing the same situation. 
 
-7. **Power Overwhelming** 
 
Yes the title is clearly a nod to Starcraft (for those asking). This track is some mature dry aged cheddar. Having found his feet with a fresh start in an alternate dimension our protagonist feels all powerful, yet he's somewhat conflicted. Just as he's starting to get the hang of this world, a shattering moment of clarity dawns on the boy. He realises that he had never been in an ""alternate dimension"" to begin with, nor had he found any sense of independence. he was simply existing within the imagination of the girl. Being toyed with and manipulated as a literal toy-figurine on her shelf. 
 
-9. **Dead Plains** 
 
The lyrics to the song describe a landscape of salt and wires. This is a dark interpretation of the world our protagonist now feels imprisoned by. The world (our female protagonists shelf) is alive only in the imagination of the girls mind. In a destructive, paradoxical spiral, the girl continues to slowly destroy this world, with our boy inside of it. You see, having become self aware of her part in all of this, she begins to cry. The salt from her tears seep into the landscape, destroying all life and with it, oxygen begins to dwindle, suffocating our protagonist. Worst yet, the more she hurts him, the more she cries. 
 
*""Now she cries for her friend, but it's the sadness in her heart in which she's grown to depend.""*
 
*This song could also been seen as the creation of the ""Weeping Wastelands"" in an alternate dimension.*
 
-5. **Fireworks** 
 
Having both realised their wrong doings, it's time to grow up and leave all the painful memories behind. Together the couple burn the toys that once occupied the shelf. The song is about tackling issues head on, as a couple and highlights how powerful two people can be together. After all they'd been through, what could possibly stand in their way?
 
*This ending could also be seen an alternate ending to Chronicles (Neverbloom). While in Chronicles our protagonist burns all their memories and moves on, in Fireworks we see the couple attempting to burn their pasts together.*

I'd never actually ended an album on a ""happily ever after"", but it's only deceptively positive and I'd like to briefly go into some personal detail explaining why. When ordering the tracks there was no chance that this ""ending"" were to ever happen in real life between me and my partner. While some would consider this to be an uplifting song, this to me is the saddest of the bunch. While writing these lyrics, I felt like I was slowly whittling any semblance of self-respect I had left. My own pipe-dreamt ""sweet nothings"" all the while thinking “imagine if"". Painting this picture of what I wished could happen, made it even harder to stomach as I began to learn it wouldn't. That's why this song is so personal for me. 
 
-------------------
 
I want to reinforce that the order of songs presented here is just my order. You may rearrange these songs in whatever order you so please. Maybe your character is stuck living in the Dead Plains, or maybe Save Yourself is your finale. Maybe you don't care about any of this and just like listening to the songs, good on you! The point is that it was my intention to reach a level of simplicity in the lyrics that the order of the songs are interchangeable and if you use your imagination, you can create your own story. CHOOSE YOUR DESTINY! p.s. I'm going to offer an example of an alternate order in the TL;DR
 
There's one final thing I'd like to address before I send this one off. These characters being ""kids"" is intended to give the album a sense of wonderous adventure. However, another part of being a child is being selfish, spoilt and ignorant. This poses an interesting question to the listener/reader. Are we meant to feel sorry for this boy? I mean, he seems like kind of a dick right? He seems to bring all these issues upon himself and then whine about it in a big charade of ego-centric rants. Are we meant to feel bad for Tetsuo? Chehiro from Spirited Away seems like kind of a brat, and don't get me started on Bojack Horseman. The truth is that somewhere between writing Save Yourself and now, a long winded rant about my lyrics, I found myself admitting that I have some extremely narcissistic qualities. It's been difficult for me to come to terms with and it's a huge reason why this album is just so damn personal to me. The shroud is off and although unintentionally so; I am very exposed. That's why it took so long to write this damn thing. But it had to be done, and so as I sit here amongst family, on New Years Day I figured ""what better time to reflect?"". **Thanks for reading y'all!**
 

--------------------
**TL;DR**
 
*There is a phone number in ""Contact"" (track 6). 1803-642-795. by rearranging the tracks in this order (1, 8, 10, 3) a story will unfold through the lyrics. This is just one of many orders that can be done, but this was the order that was relevant to me, your order may be different.*
 
*Here's a brief summary of my order:*
 
-1. boy meets girl
-8. conflict 
-10. It's over 
-3. Receive call to action 
-6. Accept call to action 
-4. It's dark down here 
-2. Actually it's not so bad! 
-7. I'm really happy, i think? 
-9. Fuck it i lied, I'm miserable, wbu? ""yeah me too"" 
-5. let's get back together fuck the haters 
 
*Here's a more conceptual way of looking at it:*
 
-1. boy meets girl 
-8. conflict 
-10. It's over 
-3. continues to receive phone calls from another dimension 
-6. finally answers calls from another dimension 
-4. gets sucked through the phone line and spat out in other dimension. It's dark and scary 
-2. it's actually not so bad, maybe I could stay in this other dimension for a while. 
-7. Yeah, I'm really starting to get the hang of this. Oh wait, this is a false sense of security. I'm now finding that this was never another dimension at all and I've never been in control. I was simply living out fantasies, through girls imagination as a toy on her shelf. 
-9. shit, now she's self aware and this dimension/world is crashing down with me in it! I need to get out of here before her sadness kills us both. But the more she kills me, the sadder she gets! ARGH!!! 
-5. Well, I think we can both admit it's time to say goodbye to the toys. Let's grow up and try move on together. 
 
*Here's a random alternate order that might make sense:*
 
-3. Receive call to action 
-1. boy meets girl (she's a bit wild) 
-5. It's all fireworks in the beginning 
-6. they talk all the time on the phone 
-7. boy going crazy ""you don't call me like u used to bae!"" (fred durst voice) 
-4. boy starting to spiral out of control 
-8. conflict 
-10. It's over 
-9. fuck, I'm still emotionally trapped in her web. 
-2. ah maybe i just need to change my outlook.

First off, does anyone know if the member in question out as gay or bisexual? I myself am a guy, and if he is that would I guess explain what happened. I literally just left Attila’s Ragefest in Tampa Florida a bit early because my ride home didn’t want to stay out too late so I decided to buy a CD before I left. I went over to Volumes’ merch tent hoping to buy Different Animals, but they were all out so I slid over to the SS booth. I asked the merch guy for a copy of You Can’t Stop Me and saw that this specific member of the band was sitting behind him next to a girl. He offered to sign the CD, so of course I said yes. Trying to be polite, I introduced myself. He said he couldn’t hear me, and then motioned to get closer to him and say it again in his ear. When I got closer he put his arm around me completely and rested his head on my shoulder and leaned into like he wanted to fall asleep on me. I didn’t think anything of it, assuming he leaned in to far. He pulled back and signed the CD. He then went back to me to give it back, and trying to make small talk I told him how SS’s set was one of my favorite performances I’ve seen this year. He appeared to not have trouble hearing me that time, then leaned in again on me on even closer than the first time. He then put his arm around me again and kissed me on the cheek and said it meant a lot to him. I pulled back pretty quickly, weirded out by the small kiss. I turned around to walk away and go home, but he got up and followed behind me for a few steps before getting my attention. He the repeated how much it meant to him that I complimented the SS set. I turned around again trying to leave but before I could go he took another step toward me and grabbed my ass firmly with both his hands. He again repeated that what I said meant a lot to him. I quickly pulled away, very scared and shook up by it. I just walked away as fast as I could after that, scared he would follow me again after what just happened. I know it wasn’t a lot what he did to me but it was 100% not consensual and very weird. Was I assaulted or harassed or something and why would he do that? I only made this reddit because I wanted to ask for help anonymously can someone tell me what happened I’m really scared

Here is the plan.

Rent out a venue for 3 days.

Hire roughly 50 bands to play back to back to back, non stop for 72 hours.  How much do you think that would cost?  How much do you think the bigger names would cost to come, do a 1 hour gig and sign autographs? $5K? $10k??  What about smaller bands? $3k - $5k?? I have no idea, but I will budget $500k for bands, unless more is needed.  

It will be 1 stage, each group will get a 1 hour gig with time for setup between bands and then another band steps right up.  This for 72 hours straight.

All food and beverages will be provided.  Also lots of free merch. $100k in free merch.

karaoke contests with big prizes.

I will pay $500 towards 1000 of you to come, everyone else will be invited.

Bands you want invited?  Other ideas?

As you can see, the dirtiest song on the album is Callout. I expected it to be About That Life tbh.

132,"I posted this as a comment in a thread yesterday, but noticed this morning while exploring the wiki that surprisingly there isn't a beginner's guide to Architects, so I'm gonna propose this as one! Feel free to suggest any amendments, it's not perfect - it's difficult to stay objective about a band I feel so strongly about, and I was struggling to think of bands for some of the 'FFO' sections.  

People mainly only seem to care/know about their latest two albums, but there's a lot more to them than that so I'm gonna run through it all chronologically, briefly give some context and a description to each record, and personally recommend some tracks. If anyone wants more personal advice (eg a certain style of track or a certain theme) then lemme know in the comments and I'll do my best to help. Alright, here goes.   

---

A bit of background (copied from Wikipedia cos I'm lazy):  
Architects are a British metalcore band from Brighton (that's where I'm from too! Rad place). Formed in 2004. The band currently consists of vocalist Sam Carter, drummer Dan Searle (whose brother Tom was the original founding guitarist), bassist Alex Dean and guitarists Adam Christianson and Josh Middleton. They have released seven studio albums and one split EP (with Dead Swans).    

---  

**Nightmares** (2006) - Their debut. They had their OG vocalist here, Matt Johnson; current vocalist Sam Carter joined not long after this LP's release. Sonically it's very inspired by mathcore, and more specifically The Dillinger Escape Plan, as all their early releases were. (They've stated before that when they were young they literally wanted to be Dillinger haha). So yeah, there's a lot of that TDEP influence clearly on show, as well as some Botch vibes and atmospheric, more melodic sections. Also a decent amount of hardcore-esque chugging too.  

*Recommended tracks:*  
To The Death  
You Don't Walk Away From Dismemberment  
They'll Be Hanging Us Tonight [great riff at 1:55]  
This Confession Means Nothing  
The Darkest Tomb.  

*FFO: The Dillinger Escape Plan, Botch, The Chariot, early Norma Jean*  

---

**Ruin** (2007) - Has some similarities to Nightmares with the technicality and melodic passages, but there's a lot more metalcore in the sound. The guitar riffing is thicker and harder, and the production is a lot nicer. Sam's first record here; there's some clean vocals sprinkled about, but way more notably he uses the low end of his vocals loads; much more than any other record they've done since.   

*Recommended tracks:*  
Hunt Them Down  
Always  
North Lane [yes the band Northlane got their name from this song]  
Low  
Save Me  

*FFO: The first album/mathcore, but you wish it was heavier/darker/more metal*   

---

**Hollow Crown** (2009) - Their first masterpiece. A lot more clean vocals here from Sam, and he changes his screaming style, featuring the higher register a lot more to create a kind of 'tortured'/emotional scream (check out the track Early Grave for a good example of this). They've also actually got proper hooks and some catchy songwriting for once. In terms of technicality I'd say it's similar to Ruin, but it's much better at it. Riffs are stronger and the mathiness is well blended in.   

*Recommended tracks: (entire record is great btw)*  
Early Grave  
Dethroned  
Numbers Count For Nothing  
Follow The Water  
One Of These Days  
Dead March  
Hollow Crown  

*FFO: Dillinger, Coalesce, slight bits of Redeemer-era Norma Jean. You could draw a comparison to Zao, but with clean vocals, I guess. Or Protest The Hero, but heavier? It has characteristics of all these bands and more, but sounds unique enough to stand alone imo.* ***If you want to get into their mathcore era stuff, start here and work your way back.***

---

**The Here and Now** (2011) - Their only truly shaky album imo, some people feel they took a misstep here. There's a strong post-hardcore/melodic hardcore influence going on; lots of clean singing, a couple ballads and mainstream sensibilities. The band themselves have completely disavowed this record and it's pretty much confined to the history books now. Still, it's not a terrible album and there are a few tracks that are properly solid, I wouldn't say you should avoid it.    
Start with the recommended tracks (also will add that Red Eyes or The Blues are alright too), and if you like em then I'd say try the whole record.  

*Recommended tracks:*  
Day In Day Out  
Delete Rewind  
BTN  
Stay Young Forever.  

*FFO: If you enjoy bands like STYG or Funeral For A Friend (idk lol), or you liked bits of That's The Spirit by BMTH but wish it banged way harder and was much, much heavier - then you might dig this record.*   

--- 

**Daybreaker** (2012) - My personal favourite Architects album, I'd call it a masterpiece but not sure if others would agree lol. Regardless it's a stunning return to form after the mess that was The Here and Now, I'm pretty sure they've said themselves that it was the album that saved their career. Also the record that really shows the beginnings of the modern day era of Architects - not only musically, but also because it's also the first time they get political on an album. It's around this time they started becoming veggie/vegan too.   
Sonically it blends everything in their career up to this point, plus a little bit more. There's still a big post-hardcore influence but the ballad-y songs and catchy bits are well executed. There's also lots of technical mathy riffing but it's not completely seizure-enducing like their early mathcore stuff. There's also bits of electronica layered in which really add to the atmospherics of the album. Yeah, I fucking love this record, sorry.  

*Recommended tracks:* Personally I would say the whole fucking thing, in order to really dig the vibe, every track is solid. But that's just my dumb opinion, so if you're new to it try out:   

Alpha Omega  
These Colours Don't Run [most obnoxious and amazing breakdown ever imo]  
Daybreak [got one of the best riffs/licks on the album]  
Truth, Be Told  
Even If You Win, You're Still A Rat (ft Oli Sykes)  
Devil's Island  
Feather of Lead  
Unbeliever  
Black Blood [a bonus track but I'm including it cos it's very popular w/ fans]  

*FFO: Thrice, Cult of Luna. Or their early mathcore stuff, but you want something a bit more straight-up*

---  

**Lost Forever // Lost Together** (2014) - Widely loved as their modern masterpiece. Full of utter bangers and continues the consistency of Daybreaker. A lot heavier than any of their records since the early stuff, but is heavier in a different way to the mathcore stuff, probably because they're tuning very low on these records and also using some experimental/unconventional tunings (they've gradually been tuning the guitars lower and lower since their debut). Their songwriting is super strong on this album, and the riffing is bouncy and groovy. More atmospherics are included on this album too. Also there's blastbeats! I love me some blastbeats.  

*Recommended tracks:* Again, I'd say the whole album, but if you need the essentials try:  

Gravedigger  
Naysayer  
Broken Cross (one of my personal fav Architects songs of all time, unreal riffing and vocals)  
The Devil Is Near  
Dead Man Talking  
Colony Collapse  
The Distant Blue [objectively the most impressive vocal performance Sam's ever done]   

*FFO: Northlane, proggy metalcore*  

---  

**All Our Gods Have Abandoned Us** (2016) - Their most recent LP, and an indisputable masterpiece. Daybreaker might be my favourite album, but if I was asked what their 'best' album is, it would be this. Stylistically it's very much a LF//LT pt.2, but better. I personally prefer the riffs on LF//LT but All Our Gods is much darker and has stronger, clearer songwriting. The atmospherics and electronica is even more prominent on this record and really ties the album together brilliantly, although each song stands strongly on their own as well and they all have unique qualities. A modern classic and an essential listen.  
Some have criticised Sam's vocals as being quite one dimensional, but I'd say listen to it and decide for yourself.  

*Recommended tracks:*  
Sorry, they're all too good. I can't pick out favourites... I mean I probably could but just try the whole thing imo. Every song is single-worthy, and so really I'd just pick something that sounds interesting to you off the tracklist and give it a listen.    
If you really only have to listen to one track though, listen to Memento Mori. It's the best and most important song they've ever done.  

*FFO: Proggy metalcore, djent... but really this is where they've come into their own and sound pretty much like themselves. If you like LF//LT, you have to listen to this album. And if you like bits of Northlane, Meshuggah, Tesseract and Deftones then deffo try this album also.*  

Important context: not long after the release of AOGHAU, primary songwriter and guitarist Tom Searle passed away of cancer. It wasn't really publicly known that he was fighting the disease until it was announced he had passed, which really adds to the impact of the lyrics on that last album, as people realised he addresses facing death and living with a terminal illness.  

---  

*Other releases:*    

**Split EP with Dead Swans** (2008) - Not too much to note here; the two songs Architects contributed are We're All Alone (which later made it's way onto Hollow Crown) and Broken Clocks, which I actually enjoy a bit more than We're All Alone, probably because it's stuffed full of blast beats and absolutely crushes. Obviously it sounds very much like Hollow Crown-era Architects, so if you like that then definitely check out this track.  


**Doomsday** (2017) - ridiculously massive single from last year; it was a riff/demo left over by Tom before he passed, and was finished by his brother Dan. If you somehow haven't heard this song yet, it's in the vein of their last two records, but with a lot more clean vocals. Solid track.

---  

---

*Rarities/B-Sides:*  

Please note: this list is **not** exhaustive and none of these tracks are instant essentials if you're just getting into Architects, but they are just a small collection of b-sides that are often overlooked, even by fans. Check em out for more cool stuff; they all sonically similar to the albums/eras they came from. You should be able to find them all on YouTube or Spotify. 

- *To The Death (2009)* - rerecording of the original opening track from Nightmares, bonus track on Hollow Crown. Much darker, heavier tone to it, with some small reworks. Combined with Sam on vocals, imo it sounds way better, especially with the breakdown. Give it a listen and you'll know what I mean. I was obsessed with this song when I first got into Hollow Crown and it actually introduced me to their debut when I looked up later on.    

- *Cracks In The Earth, Rise Against and Untitled (2011)* - Bonus tracks from Daybreaker; they're all rooted in the melodic hardcore/post-hardcore sound of this album but still are solid songs. I don't think I'm alone in thinking that Untitled is the most beautiful/best of the three. If you like Daybreaker, definitely check these out.  

- *Black Blood, Blood Bank (Bon Iver cover), Of Dust and Nations (Thrice cover) (2013)* - Additional Daybreaker-era tracks, released when it was reissued in 2013. Black Blood has become a definite fan favourite and still gets played live - it's a great track with some good heavy and clean moments. The covers are pretty good, I definitely prefer their take on the Bon Iver one (especially towards the end of the track), but try both anyway.  

- *The Shadow of Doubt, Untitled II (2014)* - tracks from the deluxe version of LF//LT. Shadow of Doubt is an utter rager that is pretty punky and is a punch in the face at just over 2 minutes long: If you like when they up the pace/tempo on LF//LT then you *have* to listen to this track. Untitled II is another short track similar to some of the atmospheric stuff you hear on Daybreaker (although ofc it has the tone of LF//LT). 

- *Wait and Bleed (Slipknot cover) (2015)* - Yeah, this was a thing that happened. Release with Rocksound Issue #200. It was alright I guess. I prefer the original - the heavy parts of this cover are great and Sam manages to chuck in an infamous BLEGH, but the cleans don't fit as well imo.  

- *Silver Bullet (2016)* - On the UK Deluxe/HMV exclusive version of AOGHAU. Features one of my all-time favourite Architects riffs and a great chorus. Solid track that could and probably should have been on the main record imo. If you dug AOGHAU and want more, this is a nice lil cherry on top of a great album.   

- *Territorial Pissings (Nirvana cover) (2017)* - Done live for the BBC Radio 1 Rocks event. Sounds really cool with the super low tuned guitars. It's a bit of fun and a pretty decent cover.  

That's enough for now, I've just added these in as a few people have mentioned in the comments that I should. If people still want more I'll do some digging and find some deep cuts!

---

Hopefully this all helps! Architects are one of the best metalcore bands around and imo any fan of the genre should try to listen to Hollow Crown, Daybreaker, LF//LT and AOGHAU. They've inspired a lot of the bands you see posted here today and the scene owes a lot to them for being one of the most creative, interesting, thoughtful and inspiring bands around.   


*Edit: Slight formatting mistake*  
*Edit 2: Based on some comments and after some consideration I've decided to change the description of The Here and Now slightly. I was a bit heavy handed and probably could have been less harsh on it. Thanks for feedback!*  
*Edit 3: Added a Rarities/b-sides list after some requests/mentions of one. Not complete but I think it's a nice start!*

144,"Hello everyone. My name is Devin. I've been an active member of this sub for about 2 years now.

Several months ago, my band Thousand Below quietly signed our first Recording Deal with Rise Records. Today, for the first time, I have the privilege to announce that I am signed to one of my favorite labels of all time.

Since I was about 15 years old, becoming an artist on Rise has been an absolute life goal (I legitimately wrote a brief paper on it in 10th grade lol). There were many times I doubted I'd ever get here. There were days I wanted to quit and never touch an instrument again. There were days I literally couldn't afford to eat because I spent my last $10 on a pack of strings. 

I've made countless mistakes, I've hurt dozens of people that I cared for, and I've been crossed by those I implicitly trusted more times than I'd like to dwell upon.
I've lost many friends and loved ones from my life over the years it has taken me to actually achieve this goal. So many of the things I cherished most (relationships, a steady/high-paying job, my own apartment), are no longer relevant to my future or to my happiness. It's surreal. You exert so much effort, working for so long just to finally achieve a goal, and then watch as the life you built in the meantime falls apart around you. In a sense, music destroyed my life in a beautiful way.

I've accomplished nothing of true significance as of yet, but I will do everything I can to not squander this opportunity. Music is the only thing in my life that consistently helps me cope with my issues, more than any drink, any substance or any person ever has. And though I am far from any kind of mastery of my talent, I desperately hope that what we've created will resonate with someone out there facing their own challenges.

For those curious, the past year (2016) was by far one of the most unpleasant I've ever had. Much of the music you'll hear as we progress, was written on an old acoustic guitar in the middle of the countless nights I was overwhelmed with depression and anxiety. I know for fact that everyone in this band has put their absolute heart and soul into the songs we made, and now that I'm in a better state of mind, I'm able to look back at what we accomplished in 2016 with pride. Every day, life slowly improves. Or maybe I'm just learning to look at the bright side more. I'm not sure honestly.

Below is our debut single, ""Tradition"". This is one of the first songs we wrote and shot a music video for with the monumentally talented Aaron Marsh. Please take a moment to watch, the more views and plays we can achieve, the better. ""Tradition"" is also available for purchase on iTunes for those so inclined. If you don't have time to listen to the song, or if you don't want to spend money on the music, please simply share the link with someone. I want so badly to spread this as far as possible, and you can help, more than you realize.

I'm so happy to be a part of this community.
I'm so honored to be a part of this genre.
I'm proud to share this with the world. 

Today is the happiest I've ever been."

No one likes you, no one wants you anywhere near them, and when Sam tells you to get the fuck out, that’s your cue.

Super bummed I can't make it, but there was little chance I could fly across the world to do so haha. 

Anyone going to the final Warped today - **go to ETID's set.** This band are basically Warped legends; they've always been THE Warped band imo, as they work so fuckin hard and they fit the Warped format so well, plus it's been by their side since the very beginning.

No one knows permanence quite like you // There's a ruthlessness in all that you do // This is not about what we deserve // There's no bias in the misery served // C.A.N.C.E.R // So watch the sun sink into the sea // There is a perfect peace but don't wait up for me // When we all fade away // And this world can't bare another day // There will be no fight in broken bliss // I feel it now more than ever // A reaper's watch // My life ready to sever // Your name carries more than disease // A symbol of man brought to his knees // Find a little light and hold it close // Don't lose sight of what matters most // This is a burden we all carry together // Waiting in the wings, so we never say never.

225,"This really isn't some secret. Every Time I Die are some of the hardest workers in the game. They pump out solid content regularly. They haven't watered down their approach at all. They tour regularly and relentlessly. And they've been doing it for 20 years. They already get mad props for that. 

I've been following them since Hot Damn! and never have had the chance to see them live. So when I found out they'd be within 2 hours of me in Fargo, and for *18 freakin' bucks*, there was no way I was missing that show. 

Here's the next level props they deserve. They're still about as fucking accessible and approachable as any group you'll find. Still after all this time there's no stage barrier. They still encourage on stage crowd participation. They engage with everybody. And after blistering through an hour+ set, who was at the goddamn venue exit immediately following their last track? 

Andy and Jordan. 

I mean less than 5 minutes after their last song they were in the front of the venue taking pictures, doing meet and greets, just being genuinely good people. Jordan was sweaty like fuck. I mean sopping wet. Where he finds the energy and motivation to run around still after all this time I'll never know. 

Then after leave the venue I see the crew loading up the gear. What do I discover? They're traveling in mother fucking rented vans and U-hauls. It answered my earlier questions which were:

1.) Where's the bus?

2.) How are these tickets 18 dollars?

These guys have seen the world and here 20 years into their careers are traveling rural parts of the Upper Midwest and Canada in rented vans and U-hauls and putting $18 prices on their tickets. 

If they think people don't notice this. If they think people don't put two and two together, I hope they realize they're mistaken. 

Mad props ETiD. You deserve it. Above and beyond.

We hope that our music has encouraged you in some way, especially our latest record, The Will To Rebuild. A lot of emotion &amp; personal torment went into that record &amp; I believe that’s what sets it apart from our other releases.

306,August Burns Red - Phantom Anthem Discussion Thread!
307,"So I've been going to hardcore shows for a while now, and it's literally my favorite thing to do, hopping in the moshpit and getting rodwy af. 
As of recent, the crowds have been getting less and less enjoyable for me. 
Mosh pits at metalcore shows are very rare now, with all these kids doing windmills with their arms and hardcore dancing. I get that you're releasing your anger and everything, but I feel like it's ruining the show for most people. If you want to flail your arms and fight invisible ghosts, you should stand in the back away from the mosh pit.
I spoke to someone doing the hardcore dancing thing at a show once, and told him he had nice moves, but I wished we could go back to old-school moshing of just pushing the fuck out of people. He said I was fucking gay for saying that.
There's still some great moshing some metal and hardcore shows, but it's getting more rare. 
At least punk shows still know what's up lol.
I'm curious if anyone agrees with me, or if you have any opinions on this.

EDIT: I'm from southern california, idk if it's different in other states.

338,"I know this will most likely never be seen by ERRA but I still want to write this just to get it off my chest. 
I also want to apologise in advance for the long read and sappiness.

I have struggled with depression and unhappiness for a while now, and it has recently gotten worse.
The worse It got the more I found myself listening to Metal, specifically Metalcore and Deathcore. Even tho I have listened to BTBAM for about 10 years and FAE for about 4, only in the last 7 months have I fully embraced it. 

One day I decided to start lurking this sub reddit and I kept noticing people talk a lot about this band ERRA. The first time I listened to Drift I was put in a trance. JT's screams which are harsh and gentle at the same time, into jesses cleans which IMO are the best in the genre, all topped off by beautiful guitar solos. I was stunned at how beautiful metal could be.

Well today ERRA gave me one of the most simple yet happy and memorable moments of my life.
I was driving through the Tasmanian country and decided to put Drift on. A little bit later it started bucketing with rain but the sun was still out.

It was like everything aligned for this perfect moment. Hearing Jesse sing ""I'm not giving up I'm giving in"" while driving along a river lined with lush green trees, with rain pouring over it all and the sun making this perfect golden glow, it gave me the most genuine smile I have had in ages.

I can't thank ERRA enough for making Drift. This one moment has given me so much and it wouldn't of happened without them.

I also want to thank /r/Metalcore for pointing out bands such as ERRA. I had no idea that they existed until i started browsing this subreddit.

Thanks for reading my sappy letter.

Much love to you all."

Two nights ago I saw Wage War and ADTR in Nashville (the show was amazing). It was a much smaller venue than I've ever seen ADTR in so we were packed tight. I manage to hold my ground front and center about two people back from the barrier before ADTR went on with my buddy on my right and these two smaller girls on the left. 

Right into the first song one of the girls begins elbowing and punching me in the face deliberately because she thought the movement of the crowd pushing me into her was something I was controlling. She continued this for about half of the set, even  pinching my arm and leaving [this](https://i.imgur.com/DOMclV9.jpg).

I tried to get security to notice but to no avail. If she had been a guy I wouldn't have hesitated to give it right back to him, but we all know how me standing up for myself would've gone down in the situation. I would've been called out by the band and sent home with a possible assault charge. 

This post was mainly to vent about this asinine behavior, but I also wanted to hear if anyone's dealt with a similar situation and how they dealt with it.

Edit: for those telling me that I should've said something, I did. In between songs I'd tell her to knock it off and that I couldn't do anything about the movement of the crowd. 

She just did this smirk and didn't respond. So yeah, it was mildly infuriating to say the least. "

Hi /r/Metalcore,

I’ve been listening to metal and hardcore for many years and it’s been fun and interesting to observe all of the different mosh call ‘memes’ that have come and gone. Because I'm insane I decided I'd list them. Here’s the start of The Complete Taxonomy of Mosh Noises.

The rules for inclusion are simple: the vocalisation in question cannot be considered ‘lyrics’. It can either be a sound, an exclamation, or a short phrase directed at the listener.

The examples on my list are simply the ones that occured to me first and are by no means the original or only of any given 'type'. The list is definitely not exhaustive and I invite you to comment with your personal favourites and with ones that I've missed!

384,"Hello all

I am not sure if this is the right place to submit my story, but I had to do it somewhere. I'm devastated after the terrible news, but this story will be happy.

Unknown day, evening, I've been talking to my girlfriend about the future, what's the plan for life, how are we gonna live together. At some point, she told me that she dreamed of proposing on stage. I only replied ""maybe in the future"", but I knew it will be at Architects concert. The problem was - how I am suppose to organize such event? To be honest, I had no plan, I just bought the engagement ring.

2014 March 28th, Warsaw, Poland, together with my girlfriend (yet) we've been sitting on the stairs. I had no idea what to do. Suddenly, I've spotted a friendly soul. It was Tom. I left my girl and rushed to him. He has been shocked, positively. He said to me that we have to go at the backstage to find Sam (for those who might not know, Architects vocals).
Together with Sam and Tom, we made a plan - they will let me come in to the backstage when they will play Red Hypergiant. I passed the ring to Sam, so he could hide it safely. Also, he gave me 2 bright green passes, so the security would let me in.

Everything was set, the party started. After three great shows the time for Architects coming up was near. I started to get really nervous. Red Hypergiant came in no time (although it's the second last song on the setlist). I took my girlfriend to the backstage, everything was set - she knew nothing. Sam introduced me. We arrived at the scene and  I got REALLY nervous this time, all those staring people got me forgot my line. So I just said that I'd like to propose to my girlfriend right now.

She said yes.

Here's the [vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQkr6U5vJzE) - credits to Dan, who recorded this. I'm really grateful.

You might think what this story is doing here, but randomly walking Tom near the club saved my day. Without this encourter, no one would ever let me in to even ask for favor.

This is how I will remember Tom. As a kind soul. As a man, who made my girlfriend's (and partially mine) dream come true.

Thank you, Tom. You have a special place in my heart and you will never be forgotten."

391,"We hear about this shit a lot (i.e. whether it’s right or wrong in terms of safety at shows, and harming others not partaking in general), but, however you feel about that, I think the more pressing topic is this — live shows are terrible at smaller venues where avoiding this kind of behavior is damn near impossible. My most recent experience was at Gideon/Polaris/Varials last night, where the crowd killing and hardcore dancing took up 90% of the fucking venue (venue room could probably fit 150 people max). 

Polaris had the sense to make the entire crowd come forward before they started, thus collapsing the gaping hole in the middle where the douchebags were roaming free, and it made the show experience 100x better (complete with more traditional circle pits, and jumping up and down). Unfortunately, once Gideon took the stage the crowd killing was far more intense, naturally, and people were being targeted in the crowd for “revenge” (the perpetrator was crowd killed badly, so he had to come at his attacker even harder later in the set harming him and everyone nearby). 

Taking fan experience completely out of it, the bands themselves (minus Polaris) had a terrible experience. They constantly asked for the crowd to get more into it, bemoaned the quality of the pit and asked for circle pits that never came, because no one wanted a right hook to the face or back of the head if they went up front (people in front were constantly hit from behind). 

This is just one of many poor experiences in the last 5 years at smaller venues that let too much real estate devolve into crowd killing and hardcore dancing with the intent to harm. I’m all about moshing and taking a hit or two (I’ve been going to these shows for 15+ years after all, and I’ve done my time in pits of all kinds), but this shit is straight up ridiculous. I love supporting local and small acts, especially at these smaller venues, but the experience is **severely** lacking nowadays and it’s sad. Teenagers risk getting beat to fucking hell if they go to these shows and that’s not how you cultivate a young fan base, or give them a great experience in general.

To be clear, this isn’t a “back in my day” moment. Smaller venues are still just as great when the music is more metal-oriented (i.e Polaris had zero crowd killing because their sound didn’t lend themselves easily to that shit), or at shows with security that actually keeps the more aggressive people in line. I dunno what would ultimately help but something needs to be done or the smaller venue experience will be dominated by hardcore dancing hardos. "

My mom (who knows basically nothing about this sort of music, by the way) is outside working on the yard, but she just came inside for a minute and heard what I was listening to. 

Her reaction was “that sounds like your dad’s music.” 

Well, shit. She reinforced the dad-rock insult that she doesn’t even know exists. Reverence must REALLY sound like “dad music” if even mothers who know nothing about rock/metal classify it as such.

It was really cool. Such a down to earth guy, and he's my legit favorite vocalist (as I am one myself) so it was very amazing to be able to just converse and play with him!

We plan on playing more and also chilling when I see them while studying in the Netherlands this fall,

528,"How's it going everyone?

I'm currently a graduate student at Colorado State University and I'm conducting some research to acquire my Master's degree in psychological anthropology. The topic of my research is metal music, but more specifically how involvement, engagement, and love of metal music and metal music shows can have positive effects on mental health and well-being. I'm really passionate about metal music and one of my goals in this research project is to show how listening to metal music, going to shows, and being involved in a community such as this can have a positive effect on the lives of fans - a lot of previous studies and popular media haven't really shown metal music to be a hobby of positive value and so I hope that through this work that I can show that there's a lot more to it than many believe.

Over the course of the last few months I've gone to an *absurd* number of shows, have interviewed a lot of amazing people, and have seen some pretty great things. The next stage of my research is in the form of a survey, which you can find [here](https://tinyurl.com/moshpitsmentalhealth). In the survey there are a number of topics that I'd like to investigate: demographics, identity questions, some issues about stigma and belonging, a series of questions on mental health, and then a concluding section about your experiences at live shows. The survey moves pretty quickly, taking only around 20-30 minutes to complete depending on the speed in which you answer.

One of the main goals I set for this study from the onset was to have it be about metal music and metal fans, as metal fans themselves see it. I want to portray the music, the scene, and the people as accurately as possible, and it wouldn't be possible without the conversations I've had with people at shows this summer and without the help of you all through this survey. I'll be hanging around the thread for a bit, so if you have any questions about the survey, my research, or my tastes in metalcore, feel free to ask!

Thanks again!

tl;dr - Master's research on metal, take the survey [here](https://tinyurl.com/moshpitsmentalhealth) 

Edit: 8/21/2016 - Thanks everyone! I'm overwhelmed by all of the support that you all have given me, I really truly appreciate all the kind words. Like I stated in a cross-post over in /r/metal, once the paper is written and approved, I'll be back to post the study itself. It will probably occur around May of next year, but I'll still be here, lurking and posting under my real username. I'll be sure to give the sub a shoutout in my Acknowledgements section :)"

Im too ashamed to tell any of my friends and my family would never treat me the same. Idk why I feel this way. Even if I've had the best day of my life when I'm alone at night It all feels so meaningless. Just everything feels empty and fake. Like nothing I've done or ever will do has value to it. I used to just think like this on occasion but now its every night. I can't claim to say nobody cares about me IRL but I honestly wish that was true. I can't fully bring myself to go through with it because of the fear of hurting those around me. So I guess I'm just stuck here to suffer. I don't want to be loved or cared about by anyone. I just wanna be forgotten so I can leave in peace.I dont belong in their life or anyones. Again I know there are more appropriate places to post this on so I apologize. Sorry.

722,"I might be too young to make the statement for the entirety of the genre*, but I think this year has had so many amazing releases. Newer bands have been coming out with albums that show clear progression and veteran bands are showing exactly why they're bastions of the genre. Of course, there are some exceptions, but this list of releases is why I think this is one of the best years. Feel free to agree/disagree, add your own, here are the remarkable releases for me in chronological order. AOTY is going to be really tough for me.  


Code Orange - Forever: Of all the beatdown releases this year (Varials, Kublai Khan, etc), this one is the most unique and really put Code Orange on the map for many including myself. 

Northlane - Mesmer: What they were going for with Node with far better execution. I know many will still prefer Adrian-era Northlane, but I think this album really steers them in the right direction after the missteps with Node.

While She Sleeps - You Are We: These guys have consistently put out great metalcore and this is no exception. I think this album has the most ""bangers"" so far for them and shows improvement in their songwriting and musicianship. 

Currents - The Place I Feel Safest: Easily their best release to date. Angry, visceral, and raw while still having a fair amount of technicality. Excellent lyrics and songwriting, too.

Dayseeker - Dreaming is Sinking // Waking is Rising: By far Dayseeker's best release so far. Rory's performance is top-notch and the Garrett Russell feature complements it perfectly. Emotionally and lyrically, this is probably the most powerful album for me this year. It's an incredibly dark and depressing story, which I tend to like. 

Make Them Suffer - Worlds Apart: They can be polarizing with some liking their deathcore era more and others liking this style more. This album is really well rounded for me with inspiration from various genres. While Neverbloom and Old Souls were very good, I think they found their own unique niche with this that sounds different from a lot of other bands in the genre. Sean's vocals are excellent both on the album and live, and I think Booka is more talented than Louisa and her sound fits MTS better. 

Oceans Ate Alaska - Hikari: While only a sophomore release, this band sounds like they've had many more years under their belt. This album sounds a lot more mature than their debut while still keeping the chaos they are known for. Also, Chris Turner is some sort of superhuman drummer so bonus points for that. 

Wage War - Deadweight: Blueprints proved for me nobody does ""generic"" metalcore better than Wage War and this album continues to prove that for me. They're not reinventing the wheel and that's what keeps me coming back to them.

Counterparts - You're Not You Anymore: One of the greatest bands on the more hardcore side of metalcore. This release improves further on their sound and hits the ground running and doesn't stop until the end. It's a short album but it's as long as it needs to be because the overall package is fantastic.

August Burns Red - Phantom Anthem: Every member of this band is a master at what they do. Every song sounds like it has a purpose on the album and isn't just filler. Only time and listens over the course of a longer time period will really show if it's their best to date for me (that title still belongs to Constellations) but whether it's the best for them or not, ABR has just set the bar so high that even their mediocre is better than many other bands' best.

Converge - The Dusk In Us/I Can Tell You About Pain: Putting these two in the same line because the EP is only a few songs. As one of the bands who invented metalcore, the expectations are very high. I'll admit I've never been that into them, but the singles recently, particularly ""A Single Tear"" are really turning me on to them. I won't be surprised if the full album becomes a modern classic once it's been released for a little bit given Converge's stature in the genre as a whole.

Polaris - The Mortal Coil: I know only a few songs have released, but I'm still in awe that this is their studio debut. The singles not only are unique and downright bangers, but they sound like they're coming from a band several albums in. If the whole album is on par or even better than the singles, I can see Polaris becoming HUGE.

738,"Hi r/metalcore,

It’s Shane from For All Eternity here.

I write this post as both an exclusive offering of content to this community &amp; most importantly a tribute to my dear friend George Christie.

Today marks 6 months since George took his own life on January 31st of this year &amp; his passing still sits heavy with myself &amp; the members of FAE.

Some of you know George as the former guitarist of Shields UK, but what you may not know about George was his amazing compositional &amp; production work for bands like ours &amp; many others.

His work on our recent record ‘The Will To Rebuild’ shaped the emotional landscape of the entire album. His contributions are as important as any other instrument found on the record, he was a huge part of what we did.

We first worked with George on ‘Metanoia’ in 2015 and became good friends in no time. George’s contributions on ‘Metanoia’ where basically an afterthought. We enjoyed the record, but we wanted to inject some more character &amp; polish to the release. George didn’t disappoint.

Our guitarist Nick is a producer &amp; spoke on a daily basis, sharing in their love of producing &amp; creating music. Always sharing ideas, concepts, musical knowledge, etc.

This went on for years.

Early work on ‘The Will To Rebuild’ begged the question, what do we want to do? What direction do we take our sound?

It was then that we decided from the beginning of the writing process, we are going to write a record where heavy music meets movie soundtrack, involving George from day 1.

He was so excited to be a part of the process, no one had offered him such a vital role in a record before. Sure enough he perfectly composed a musical score alongside our own instrumentation &amp; vocals. We couldn’t have asked for a more fitting &amp; real representation of what this record was meant to be. He worked hard.

Throughout the process, myself &amp; George connected in so many ways. 

After I had tracked the vocals, he told me how the emotion in my voice was tangible, he’d never heard anything so real before, so emotionally powerful he said, I was completely humbled by his kindness. He told me on many occasions how he wept whilst composing the production, he told me he had never felt so emotionally tied of any work he had ever done before. A few pieces of music he created for the record led him to sob uncontrollably, he couldn’t help it he said, it was so beautiful &amp; painful. It was real.

The true &amp; personal nature of the lyrics  on the record became a big talking point between us &amp; eventually caused George to open up to me. I learnt of his depression. He had told me about his previous attempts to take his own life &amp; how he struggled day-to-day. George lived in the UK &amp; I live here in Australia, yet I had a more intimate &amp; real friendship with him than I have with friends whom live 5 minutes away. He was a beautiful human being, who showed nothing but kindness &amp; love to all those who encountered him.

I will never forget one of the most profound things he ever said to me. He said that he believed his work on our record was a huge accomplishment of his life, he had never connected with a piece of music on such a personal level as he did with this. I would sometimes receive messages from him out of the blue, completely over the moon with what we created together, he would often say similar things to Nick also. He couldn’t believe that someone had entrusted him with their art, he said we will never know what that means to him.

I look back on those words &amp; cannot help but be wrought with emotion. After years, we still never had the chance to meet in person, which breaks my heart.

As a tribute to George’s memory &amp; unparalleled talent. We have decided to share with you, a few of the isolated production tracks created by George, alongside our own Nick Page for 'The Will To Rebuild'.

Please find the unlisted links for September, The Vacated, Nightmare, Derailed &amp; Clearer here:

Please note, these are the actual tracks pulled from our record, some moments within the production tracks are intentionally empty to accentuate the bands performance.

With that in mind, we hope you enjoy the amazing work of our dear departed friend, George Christie.

You are &amp; will forever be a member of For All Eternity.

Rest In Peace, 1993 - 2018."

You get like ten bands, some of whom don't even sound anywhere near what it claims, but because some Rick Florino asshole thinks it sounds a bit like something else so it must be, it's given approval.

I know this genre is slightly unpopular, but for anyone who actually enjoys it - like me - here's a full list of EVERYTHING I've heard that is more than %50 nu-metal-influenced-metalcore and why. If I haven't added anything, it's probably because it hasn't been uploaded with that in the description, and no I'm not including all of Chugcore's incredibly inaccurately-tagged Downtempo bands. I hope people will keep adding to it with things I've missed, or at least find something cool they haven't heard because Wikipedia or others are misleading.

756,"I recently was browsing through some other subs for genres of music I like and almost every comment is always about how bad some artist or band is or how this or that song shouldn't be in the sub because it's ""not the same genre"" and it just seems like everyone in other music subs just hate that music. 

But here it seems like even if someone dislikes a song or band they're fairly respectful about it  don't resort to attacking other users for their taste. It's nice and I just wanted to say thanks to everyone for not being elitist assholes who can't accept people have differing opinions. "

815,"This might get heavily downvoted, but I need to vent about new Parkway Drive (PWD), as a lifelong fan who has been there since the beginning. We need to acknowledge old-school PWD may be dead, and hopefully accept new PWD in a different light.

&amp;nbsp;

PWD got me into this genre back in 2007 with Horizons (Boneyards still gives me goosebumps), and I think their first three albums ([Killing with a smile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQvijGmsNIc), [Horizons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TulVILhfxFM), and [Deep Blue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVB0-QXYuTI&amp;t=837s)) are damn near perfect ([Atlas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7UYsRaf3VE) was great too, just not to that standard). Their great live shows, raw and unique sound, and perfect complimentary breakdowns hooked me immediately. Even as their sound progressed in Deep Blue and Atlas, with more stadium pleasing hits, complex composition and softer elements, they retained the core of what made them great (examples include [The River](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5BDE3LPqck), [Wild Eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8xKUoH_lU), [Blue and the Grey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9gr54eptNI) and [Alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKCSWFN7RrQ)). 

&amp;nbsp;

[Ire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_hUI_fbKe8&amp;index=2&amp;list=PLcZMZxR9uxC8HJVsXnkKlP9p4sXmr8BTN) represented a colossal, seismic shift in their sound. It's more hard rock, streamlined and, quite honestly, more generic than ever. [Crushed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m4685liWb0) and [Dedicated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNCQDNArqJo) might represent the lone old-school sound that PWD perfected (with [Sound of Violence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTKUYgR1Ii0) coming close), and even then there are big breaks in the riffs and chorus in Crushed for Winston to talk (almost spoken word-esque, but not as much as [Writings on the Wall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRIXDpchIVc)), while Dedicated just feels less-powerful than usual for PWD (Dedicated still represents my favorite song on the album). Every other song, especially [Vice Grip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ItHNdrPEh0), is the epitome of mainstream, generic hard-rock/power metal. It's definitively not old-school PWD.

&amp;nbsp;

Listen, I get that bands grow and change over time. It's what great bands do, and PWD is a great band. But this new PWD isn't the same band that made [Guns for a show, Knives for a pro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-F2kGUSldo), [A Cold Day in Hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9lbfpiVBuE), [Boneyards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptChkpxMoQ), [Gimme AD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R27i0BsVyOA), [Romance is dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DScZ42PPIyo), [Old Ghosts/New Regrets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4rvMrmX0sI), [Unrest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkcabeM6MH8) and fucking [Dead Man's Chest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=428sktWCvaM). 

&amp;nbsp;

[The Void](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAY2bCmm8e0) and [Wishing Wells](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uwyvvxNvqQ) seems to be another big step in the direction IRE started, and I really am sad about that. I'm just one fan, so who the fuck cares what I think at the end of the day. PWD are doing their own thing, and I respect the hell out of them for doing the music they want to create now. Bands have done this before (like Bring me the horizon in a more extreme respect), and maybe that edge isn't in PWD anymore as they age. That all makes sense, and I understand. But with the release of The Void, I'm officially mourning the death of old-school PWD. I'll get my fix at the live shows, but I'm pretty sure I'm done buying their new music. I think we need to accept this change as almost an entirely new band (the break in sound is that big for me), and hopefully we can accept new PWD for what they are. The comparisons between old and new just aren't valid anymore.

&amp;nbsp;

tl;dr -- old-school PWD is dead, whether that's bad or good is up to you, but it needs to be acknowledged. "

I hate asking for money, and it makes me hurt inside to do it, but this is a real opportunity for me. If you donate, please PM me a song request/tutorial request. I don't want to ask for money without providing a service.

If you care about the local music scene at all, read this. This is unedited and uncensored, so if you don't like that, get over it. I usually keep my language on Facebook to a minimum because it offends certain people, but I feel like this is a good exception. I went to a show tonight. It was cool until one of the last bands started playing. Someone didn't like how someone else was moshing, so dude (will henceforth be referred to as ""douchebag"") hits him, knocks him down, and jumps on his head. Dude was bleeding and someone had to call him an ambulance. What douchebag did was not fucking cool and definitely not hardcore. Not hardcore at all. I have no involvement in this altercation at all except for watching it but I am still pissed as hell. THIS SHIT IS NOT OK AND IS NOT WELCOME IN OUR SCENE. Douchebag, thanks for ruining a great show for everyone. But wait, there's more, apparently dude that got knocked out played in one of the bands that played tonight. I don't know this for a fact, but if so, why the HELL would you beat up on a guy that just played music for you? Didn't you come to the show because you like the bands? Why would you hit someone that made something you like? Is your head even all there? That was so disrespectful. No one wants people like you, douchebag, in our scene. Get the hell out and get into the MMA scene if all you wanna do is start fights. Get that high school shit out of here, most of us are adults. I hope I find out who you are so I know who to hate. Moshing is not about beating the shit out of people because you think they mosh on you too much or accidentally hit you or whatever. Going to shows is about having fun and enjoying music with like-minded people. Also it was disrespectful as hell for the band to keep playing after they clearly saw that dude was knocked out, bleeding on the floor. Stop playing your fucking song if someone is seriously hurt. We can hear it on Spotify later. Life comes before art. Sorry not sorry. /rant PS Thanks [redacted] for getting the ambulance and holding it down as well as you could. Thank you to all the people that were trying to help the injured guy.

Stuff I didn't post on FB: The band that kept playing when the guy was knocked out was Adaliah so fuck them too. I was gonna buy one of their shirts but not anymore.

Edit: this is not a ""fuck hardcore dancing"" post. Dance if you want. Stay away from the pit if you are gonna get butthurt that someone accidentally hit you. Don't be like douchebag."

974,"Japan has really surprised me recently on its metalcore bands. Crystal Lake being signed to Artery Records, Crossfaith getting Headline act at Download in 2014, Coldrain, Crossfaith, Dir en Grey and The GazettE getting their own Headline tours with Dir en Grey and The GazettE on a headline tour in America which was a bit of a surprise plus much more other bands.
 
Now here is a list of Bands which I'm currently interested in.
 
[Coldrain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWnazgDoUHk) - Alt Metal but still sways into Metalcore and Post-Hardcore (Also the band which got me into heavy music.) They are still my favorate band, with great cleans and awesome riffs
 
[Crossfaith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1qqyihrPDI&amp;nohtml5=False) - Metalcore, laced with electronica, sound alot more Nu-Metal on the new record but you definitely hear the metalcore influence in them, there second record is really where they shine, especially on the song ""Stars Faded in Slow Motion""
 
[Crystal Lake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bROQ9Lse9ns&amp;nohtml5=False) - Metalcore, new record is really impressive, sounds alot like architects but still has its own edge to it, especially on tracks like ""Hades""
 
[DIR EN GREY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVBradbc-dY&amp;nohtml5=False) - They don't stick to one genre other than Metal, by far the most impressive band on this list, if you like good metalcore then their album, Dum Spiro Spero, is for you. If you want something more Crazy: Marrow of the Bone is for you. In my opinion, either their latest album Arche or Uroboros is where they shine the most.
 
[lynch.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5RPuphYry0&amp;nohtml5=False) - Metalcore/Groove Metal, they are a really good prodigy of both The GazettE and DIR EN GREY, toned down visually compared to other bands in the scene, these are an exiting band with a great record released this year.
 
[Maximum the Hormone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MIIgWu_5Ds&amp;nohtml5=False) - They are some sort of fusion of Funk Metal, Nu-Metal, Pop Punk and Hardcore Punk, on the release of their 2006 record, Buiikikaesu, they reached number one in the japanese charts, and with there latest record ""Yoshu Fukushu"" they stayed in number 1 for 3 weeks, which is impressive for a Metal band. They are a load of fun and that's all you need to know.
 
[Pay money To my Pain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0GIik5Fk2M&amp;nohtml5=False) - Metalcore/Post-Hardcore/Nu-Metal, They were a really great band, with some of the most emotional stuff i have ever listened to, however in 2013 their lead singer past away which made the band release one last record and then disbanded
 
[SiM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHQSXYNdcF8&amp;nohtml5=False) (Silence iz Mine) Alt Metal/Post-Hardcore/Reggae Punk, These are some of the most creative minds in japan, their riffs are always on point, especially in their latest album, The Beautiful People, they always experiment with their sound and it always comes out great, incorporating Hip-hop (Abel and Cain) and sometimes Extreme Metal (F.a.i.t.h)
 
[The GazettE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQNikGWT7To&amp;nohtml5=False) - Metalcore/Nu-Metal/Industrial Metal, they look crazy, and sound crazy. There latest releases have been really solid, just listen to their song ""Ugly"" and are releasing a single later this month
 
 
EDIT: Here are some new bands that really caught my fancy recently (a lot from this thread):
 
[Each of the Days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vdebwk9ATw) - Melodic Metalcore, i really like this bands style, the clean vocals remind me of southern metal and the guitar work is just straight up impressive
 
[Girugamesh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbKJo0a2eTo&amp;nohtml5=False) - Metalcore/Electronicore/Alt-Metal, I'm suprised i didn't get into this band earlier, there new stuff is straight metalcore, and so was there very early stuff but they had an alt-rock/alt-metal phase but still good non the less
 
[Her Name In Blood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg_EB5VmrEw&amp;nohtml5=False) - Metalcore/Deathcore(early), Ive seen them before but never really got into there stuff, i saw them on this thread and decided to give them a go, low and behold, they are fuckin' great and they also have a sense of humor too, which is always a bonus
 
[Nocturnal Bloodlust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5pS5kTGGgI&amp;nohtml5=False) - Deathcore/Metalcore/Nu-Metal, They are one of the craziest bands i've ever seen, full on Visual Kei Deathcore with clean vocals, it confuses me but i like it. They have a new E.P out this month, it sound like their most diverse stuff yet!
 
[Abstracts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJ9lvSM3EI8&amp;feature=youtu.be) Progressive Metal/Metalcore. Now I'll be honest, i haven't heard a lot of the stuff by them but they have definitely impressed me, and I'll be sure to listen to more!
 
Now I'm gonna give a short list of other bands on this thread which i like:
 
[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HltrwtIg7yY&amp;nohtml5=False) - Electronicore/Metalcore/EDM
 
[Babymetal... Duh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvD3CHA48pA&amp;nohtml5=False) - Heavy Metal/J-pop
 
[Takenawa Intrigue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTU4ZFZJZiU) - ""Symphonic Progressive Deathcore""/Metalcore/Djent
 
[Another Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNMan7ClJuA) - Metalcore/Post-Hardcore"

Here's more info on the talent search I started today.  I might make this an annual or semi-annual thing.  We'll see how it goes!

http://joshschroeder.com/talentsearch2014/

Anything you want to know about studio stuff or specific bands I've worked with, ask away!

Also, the new In Hearts Wake album, Earthwalker, comes out in the US tomorrow, so support my buddies from down under!  Very proud of this album.  You can see the first single and video here:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUy9ytCkEjk

EDIT 1.  I also launched a new website today.  www.joshschroeder.com

UPDATE 1.  It's 12:20am here in Bay City, MI.  I will continue to answer questions in this AMA tomorrow and the day after as well, so feel free to ask anything during my break here and I will answer them all tomorrow.  Thanks guys, this has been a lot of fun so far.  Also, please spread the word about this talent search.  Thanks!!

PS I'm trying to get In Hearts Wake to do an AMA, so bug them about it!

FINAL UPDATE:

I don't want to overstay my welcome, and it looks like the AMA is winding down anyhow, so it's best to call it here.  Thanks to everyone who asked questions, this was a lot of fun!

Please share the information on the talent search if you know anybody who you think deserves some quality studio time, but maybe can't afford it right now. I'm hoping to find a talented new band and help them break through and get signed. That's the ideal end result of this.

Here is the info on my new website. http://joshschroeder.com/talentsearch2014/

Thanks again, everyone! I'll see you guys around, as I tend to lurk this subreddit a lot."

It made me feel like shit. I know a lot of people don’t understand (quite literally) this music, but it’s uncalled for. It pisses me off that they listen to the same recycled trash only to turn around and make fun of this music and it’s culture. Definitely don’t want to hang out with them after that.

1071,"As you may have noticed, new songs release at midnight depending on each user's timezone. This has led to users in timezones ahead of others flocking to post popular songs early the second they go up on spotify. While some are genuinely excited and want to share the music, many just want to farm the internet points.

In addition, Spotify and other streaming services are not readily available to all users in the same manner as YouTube - a paywall if you will. Yes, Spotify etc. is free on desktop with registration, but if you want to listen to a single song on mobile, you need to pay.

As popular singles are usually followed up with an official music video/upload ([example of an automated official upload](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHrnIcjtTKo)) soon after, this leads to multiple posts of the same song sitting at the top of the sub. **If a music video is posted/to be posted after the midnight release, the midnight post will be removed.** 

Perhaps the tantamount reason for this rule coming about is how impatient users then post asking for leaks because they couldn't possibly wait a few hours until the song is available on their Spotify. **These timezone limits enable people in the far east to access music first, and is frustrating for western users. As a result, it encourages users to go looking for leaks, which is also against our rules. Do not post auto-generated YT links before it has released for everyone.** 

Just to re-iterate:

Don't post leaks. Don't ask for leaks. Don't link to unofficial YouTube uploads of songs. Don't try to be a smart ass and talk about leaks by saying ""l*aks"" or ""ekk-lay"" to where AutoMod doesn't catch it and notify us. We still have eyeballs and can understand what you meant on our own. That's a leak. Don't do it. You will be banned. [This rule is strictly enforced.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metalcore/comments/71hvdo/reminder_discussing_leaks_and_pirated_material_is/)

**We encourage you to post links to the song on Spotify/etc in the comments** as the artists reap the revenue from these means as well in addition to making it slightly easier for Spotify users to get right to the page. As mods, we will make a concerted effort to get these up ASAP but we cannot all be right on the money all the time, so we (and the bands) would appreciate any help you can give us with this.

There are two caveats to this rule:

* If the song is ONLY available on Spotify AFTER it has been released officially. This does NOT mean at 12:01 am EST you can post a spotify link to a newly released song.

* If you want to post a unique Spotify playlist. ""My gym playlist"" and ""My SO just broke up with me here are my angry songs"" are *not* unique. 

Examples of unique playlists [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/Metalcore/comments/8q50e2/the_blegh_list_135_songs_and_counting_with_the/) and [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/Metalcore/comments/8ori66/a_spotify_metalcore_playlist_but_the_further_down/). If you are curious if your playlist will be allowed, send us a message via the sidebar (towards the bottom).

1096,"Let's be honest, A Day To Remember is a band that has had some hits and some misses. This band used to be my favorite band of all time (until I discovered ABR, that is). After hearing their last album, I have been very interested to hear a follow up. Common Courtesy was a fantastic album in my opinion, but it followed that same ADTR style. This time around, they've done what Memphis May Fire will never do; THEY FUCKING TRIED SOMETHING DIFFERENT. And let me tell you, it worked. I now consider this to be the group's best album yet. Yes, even over Homesick and For Those Who Have Heart.

Track by track:

1. Bad Vibrations: This was the lead single, and the track that made me feel a little uneasy. It was a nice heavy jam, but the mix sounds a bit odd, and it it very inferior to their past heavy songs. With that being said, the song is still a good song, and has grown on me. 
.
.
2. Paranoia: Despite many other people's opinions, this song was the best single released, imo. The riffing is simple, but so hard hitting and honestly makes you want to throw your dog at the wall. The chorus is incredibly catchy, and if the breakdown isn't a punch to the face then I don't know what is. 
.
.
3. Naivety: I like this song, I do. But it is my least favorite on this album. The chorus is great, but the rest of the song feels a little bland. Not a bad song, but there is better stuff here.
.
.
4. Exposed: Oh boy, where do I begin with this song. FANFUCKINGTASTIC. The riffs are tasty as shit, which is a rare occurrence for ADTR, considering they're not very technical. This is one of ADTR's heaviest songs ever, and is the heaviest on this album. This song feels like Wage War had sex with Bad Omens and they had twins, Parkway Drive and Miss May I, who had a baby of their own. The final minute will make you shit a giraffe. That is all.
.
.
5. Bullfight: Why is it that all the singles are my least favorites on the album? This song is a very odd one. It's different than any other on the record. I'm not ashamed to admit that this song even gives me a bit of PTV vibes at times. This song, in all honesty, is a skipper.
.
.
6. Reassemble: Another heavy jam. This song is your average heavy ADTR song. It's a very fun listen, and is very catchy. It's no Exposed, but is an awesome song.
.
.
7. Justified: Another one of my favorites on the record. This song is the perfect mix between metalcore and pop punk. There are parts of this song that will blow you away. It has a very different feel than most ADTR songs. You will find yourself getting that beautiful chorus stuck in your head for days. One of the best songs you will find on this album for sure. 
.
.
8. We Got This: Never thought I'd say this about an A Day To Remember album, but this, I believe, is the only pop punk song on this album (regular not deluxe) besides Naivety. This is a great song. The guitar and vocals combined during the verses make for one of the main highlights of the album. 
.
.
9. Same About You: Ah, that one radio rock song found on every A Day To Remember album. This is a good song. It's a very fun listen. It is completely radio rock, and then you get hit with a very Sum 41-esque guitar solo, and then punched in the face with a very bouncy and ""holy shit did that just happen"" breakdown.
.
.
10. Turn Off The Radio: Jeremy McKinnon certainly did a fantastic job writing the melodies in the verses of this song. They show McKinnon stepping out of his comfort zone a little. The vocals on this album are very fun and enjoyable. The chorus is so catchy you'll learn the words by your second listen. 
.
.
11. Forgive And Forget: This is the first song on the album that made my jaw drop (although I did listen to it on shuffle, and this was the third one that came up). It's like Homesick's closer, but on steroids, PCP, cocaine, and anything else you can think of. The band really outdid themselves on this one. One of my favorites for sure.
.
. 
All in all, this album is not one to sleep on. A Day To Remember have certainly pushed their boundaries, and it worked very well.

1097,A Day To Remember - Bad Vibrations: Track By Track Review
1098,Architects - Gravedigger
1099,Violence (Enough is Enough) - A Day To Remember
1100,Northlane - Dream Awake [Official Music Video]
1101,And it begins...
1102,Currents - Best Memory (I've been jamming this album so much recently.)
1103,"""10 years ago a gunman barricaded himself in a schoolhouse with ten Amish girls in Nickel Mines, Pennsylvania. He took 10 girls hostage, ages ranging six to thirteen. He proceeded to shoot these young girls in the back of the head, one after another. According to survivors, the Amish girls were offering to pray for him and the oldest girl volunteered to be shot first to spare the lives of the others. 
After the shooting, moments before authorities broke into the room, this coward took his own life.
Unfortunately, we have become desensitized to horrific occurrences such as these. Maybe it's due to the frequency of these occurrences, or how quickly the news media politicizes these tragedies... or maybe it's just a lack of empathy on our part.
However, it's the response of this Amish community that has made this story continue to resonate with me and so many others even a decade after it all happened. Of course, the victimized Amish community had every right to demand for vengeance and reparations from the murderers family (he had a wife and 3 children). Nothing could ever give this community back what had been taken from them by this outsider.
But this Amish community forgave. They paid for their murderer's funeral expenses. They established a fund to help his family with financial needs, knowing that this gunman was also his family's primary breadwinner. When the media descended upon this township, they received unexpected quotes: The grandfather of one of the victims famously replied, ""We must not think evil of this man."" Another Amish father noted, ""He had a mother and a wife and a soul and now he's standing before a just God.""
To this day, this Amish community is connected to the family of the gunman. The mother of the gunman, in turn, has made new neighbors and supports the girls who survive, and is in turn supported through her current battle with cancer.
This story was life-changing for me at the age of 16. I'll never forget hearing about such a tangible example of forgiveness. So often I've been told that peace isn't practical - that the only way to protect myself is to be ready to attack others. It was a shocking, confusing, and paradigm-shifting for me to hear when I was in high school.
I'll let you draw your own implications from this story, but please don't forget this time that a small Amish community puzzled the rest of the world as their forgiveness transcended tragedy.

Seeing this pop up in my memories as a post I shared a year ago today was bizarre, given what the post was about, and what tragic events went on last night.
